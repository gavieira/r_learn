abstract = {This communication reports a further examination of venom gland transcripts and venom composition of the Mexican scorpion Thorellius atrox using RNA-seq and tandem mass spectrometry. The RNA-seq, which was performed with the Illumina protocol, yielded more than 20,000 assembled transcripts. Following a database search and annotation strategy, 160 transcripts were identified, potentially coding for venom components. A novel sequence was identified that potentially codes for a peptide with similarity to spider $\omega$-agatoxins, which act on voltage-gated calcium channels, not known before to exist in scorpion venoms. Analogous transcripts were found in other scorpion species. They could represent members of a new scorpion toxin family, here named omegascorpins. The mass fingerprint by LC-MS identified 135 individual venom components, five of which matched with the theoretical masses of putative peptides translated from the transcriptome. The LC-MS/MS de novo sequencing allowed to reconstruct and identify 42 proteins encoded by assembled transcripts, thus validating the transcriptome analysis. Earlier studies conducted with this scorpion venom permitted the identification of only twenty putative venom components. The present work performed with more powerful and modern omic technologies demonstrates the capacity of accomplishing a deeper characterization of scorpion venom components and the identification of novel molecules with potential applications in biomedicine and the study of ion channel physiology.},

abstract = {Unequal usage of synonymous codons in the gene transcript for an amino acid is known as codon usage bias (CUB). It is a unique property of gene as well as genome. Mutation and natural selection are known to be the major factors that influence CUB. Other factors encompass gene expression level, GC content, codon position, recombination rate, RNA stability and gene length. CUB analysis helps in in-depth understanding of the molecular biology, genetics and genome evolution in a species. We used bioinformatic methods to explore the pattern of CUB in MT-ATP6 gene in different classes of platyhelminthes. The analysis is based on genetic code of translational table 14 of National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) where the codon AAA codes for asparagine and TAA for tyrosine amino acid. The synonymous codon usage order (SCUO), an index of CUB, values in different classes namely cestoda, monogenea, rabditophora, trematoda and turbellaria of platyhelminths were found to be 0.43, 0.32, 0.49, 0.40 and 0.36, respectively which suggest that the codon usage bias of ATP6 gene was low (SCUO {\textless} 0.50). Highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) was found between SCUO and various GC contents indicating that GC composition had an influence on CUB. From the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis on codons, we found most of the over-represented codons in all the classes were A/T ending types, which suggested that the preferred codons were influenced by compositional constraints. The PR2 plot revealed asymmetric usage of AT and GC bases among the four fold degenerate codon families with greater usage of G and T over A and C. Highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) was found between overall nucleotide composition and its 3rd codon position suggesting that both natural selection and mutation pressure might have influenced the CUB among different classes. Neutrality analysis revealed that natural selection might play a major role. Mutational responsive index (MRI) and translational selection (P2) values elucidated that selection for translational efficiency moderately affected the codon usage bias in MT-ATP6 gene.},

abstract = {Most transfer RNAs (tRNAs) can translate more than one synonymous codon, and most codons can be translated by more than one isoacceptor tRNA. The rates of translation of synonymous codons are dependent on the concentrations of the tRNAs and on the rates of pairing of each anticodon-codon combination. Translational selection causes a significant bias in codon frequencies in highly expressed genes in most bacteria. By comparing codon frequencies in high and low-expression genes, we determine which codons are preferred for each amino acid in a large sample of bacterial genomes. We relate this to the number of copies of each tRNA gene in each genome. In two-codon families, preferred codons have Watson-Crick pairs (GC and AU) between the third codon base and the wobble base of the anticodon rather than GU pairs. This suggests that these combinations are more rapidly recognized by the ribosome. In contrast, in four-codon families, preferred codons do not correspond to Watson-Crick rules. In some cases, a wobble-U tRNA can pair with all four codons. In these cases, A and U codons are preferred over G and C. This indicates that the nonstandard UU combination appears to be translated surprisingly well. Differences in modified bases at the wobble position of the anticodon appear to be responsible for the differences in behavior of tRNAs in two-and four-codon families. We discuss the way changes in the bases in the anticodon influence both the speed and the accuracy of translation. The number of tRNA gene copies and the strength of translational selection correlate with the growth rate of the organism, as we would expect if the primary cause of translational selection in bacteria is the requirement to optimize the speed of protein production.},

abstract = {We analyze the frequencies of synonymous codons in animal mitochondrial genomes, focusing particularly on mammals and fish. The frequencies of bases at fourfold-degenerate sites are found to be strongly influenced by context-dependent mutation, which causes correlations between pairs of neighbouring bases. There is a pattern of excess of certain dinucleotides and deficit of others that is consistent across large numbers of species, despite the wide variation of single nucleotide frequencies among species. In many bacteria, translational selection is an important influence on codon usage. In order to test whether translational selection also plays a role in mitochondria, we need to control for context dependent mutation. Selection for translational accuracy can be detected by comparison of codon usage in conserved and variable sites in the same genes. We give a test of this type that works in the presence of context dependent mutation. There is very little evidence for translational accuracy selection in the mitochondrial genes considered here. Selection for translational efficiency might lead to preference for codons that match the limited repertoire of anticodons on the mitochondrial tRNAs. This is difficult to detect because the effect would usually be in the same direction in comparable codon families, and so would not cause an observable difference in codon usage between families. Several lines of evidence suggest that this type of selection is weak in most cases. However, we found several cases where unusual bases occur at the wobble position of the tRNA, and in these cases, some evidence for selection on codon usage was found. We discuss the way that these unusual cases are associated with codon reassignments in the mitochondrial genetic code.},

abstract = {The H-strand of vertebrate mitochondrial DNA is left single-stranded for hours during the slow DNA replication. This facilitates C→U mutations on the H-strand (and consequently G→A mutations on the L-strand) via spontaneous deamination which occurs much more frequently on single-stranded than on double-stranded DNA. For the 12 coding sequences (CDS) collinear with the L-strand, NNY synonymous codon families (where N stands for any of the four nucleotides and Y stands for either C or U) end mostly with C, and NNR and NNN codon families (where R stands for either A or G) end mostly with A. For the lone ND6 gene on the other strand, the codon bias is the opposite, with NNY codon families ending mostly with U and NNR and NNN codon families ending mostly with G. These patterns are consistent with the strand-specific mutation bias. The codon usage biased towards C-ending and A-ending in the 12 CDS sequences affects the codon-anticodon adaptation. The wobble site of the anticodon is always G for NNY codon families dominated by C-ending codons and U for NNR and NNN codon families dominated by A-ending codons. The only, but consistent, exception is the anticodon of tRNA-Met which consistently has a 5′-CAU-3′ anticodon base-pairing with the AUG codon (the translation initiation codon) instead of the more frequent AUA. The observed CAU anticodon (matching AUG) would increase the rate of translation initiation but would reduce the rate of peptide elongation because most methionine codons are AUA, whereas the unobserved UAU anticodon (matching AUA) would increase the elongation rate at the cost of translation initiation rate. The consistent CAU anticodon in tRNA-Met suggests the importance of maximizing the rate of translation initiation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of unequal usage of synonymous codons encoding an amino acid in which some codons are more preferred to others is the codon usage bias (CUB) and it is species specific. Analysis of CUB helps in understanding evolution at molecular level and acquires significance in mRNA translation, design of transgenes and new gene discovery. In our current study, we analyzed synonymous codon usage pattern and the factors influencing it on mitochondrial protein coding genes of 6 different hookworms i.e. Ancylostoma ceylanicum, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma tubaeforme, Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria sanguinis as no work was reported yet. The effective number of codons for mitochondrial genes suggested that codon usage bias was high in most species. The GC content was lower than AT content i.e. genes were AT rich as indicated by nucleotide composition analysis. The overall nucleotide composition along with its composition at 3rd codon position and correspondence analysis suggested that both natural selection and mutation pressure might have affected the codon usage bias in mitochondrial genes. However, neutrality plot revealed that mutation pressure might have played a major role in A. ceylanicum while natural selection might have played the dominant role in Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma tubaeforme, Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria sanguinis.},

abstract = {Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences from three species of Habronattus jumping spiders (Chelicerata: Arach-nida: Araneae) reveal unusual inferred tRNA secondary structures and gene arrangements, providing new information on tRNA evolution within chelicerate arthropods. Sequences from the protein-coding genes NADH dehy-drogenase subunit 1 (ND1), cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and subunit II (COII) were obtained, along with tRNA Val , tRNA Leu(CUN) , and large-subunit ribosomal RNA (16S) sequences; these revealed several peculiar features. First, inferred secondary structures of tRNA Val and, likely, tRNA Leu(CUN) , lack the TC arm and the variable arm and therefore do not form standard cloverleaf structures. In place of these arms is a 5-6-nt T arm-variable loop (TV) replacement loop such as that originally described from nematode mitochondrial tRNAs. Intraspecific variation occurs in the acceptor stem sequences in both tRNAs. Second, while the proposed secondary structure of the 3 end of 16S is similar to that reported for insects, the sequence at the 5 end is extremely divergent, and the entire gene is truncated about 300 nt with respect to Drosophila yakuba. Third, initiation codons appear to consist of ATY (ATT and ATC) and TTG for ND1 and COII, respectively. Finally, Habronattus shares the same ND1-tRNA Leu(CUN)-16S gene arrangement as insects and crustaceans, thus illustrating variation in a tRNA gene arrangement previously proposed as a character distinguishing chelicerates from insects and crustaceans.},

abstract = {Thousands of eukaryotes transcriptomes have been generated, mainly to investigate nuclear genes expression, and the amount of available data is constantly increasing. A neglected but promising use of this large amount of data is to assemble organelle genomes. To assess the reliability of this approach, we attempted to reconstruct complete mitochondrial genomes from RNA-Seq experiments of Reticulitermes termite species, for which transcriptomes and conspecific mitogenomes are available. We successfully assembled complete molecules, although a few gaps corresponding to tRNAs had to be filled manually. We also reconstructed, for the first time, the mitogenome of Reticulitermes banyulensis. The accuracy and completeness of mitogenomes reconstruction appeared independent from transcriptome size, read length and sequencing design (single/paired end), and using reference genomes from congeneric or intra-familial taxa did not significantly affect the assembly. Transcriptome-derived mitogenomes were found highly similar to the conspecific ones obtained from genome sequencing (nucleotide divergence ranging from 0{\%} to 3.5{\%}) and yielded a congruent phylogenetic tree. Reads from contaminants and nuclear transcripts, although slowing down the process, did not result in chimeric sequence reconstruction. We suggest that the described approach has the potential to increase the number of available mitogenomes by exploiting the rapidly increasing number of transcriptomes.},

abstract = {Damselflies and dragonflies, of the order Odonata, have distinct body plans and predatory abilities. Knowledge of their various evolutionary histories will allow for an understanding of the genetic and phenotypic evolution of insects. Mitogenomes are suitable materials to elucidate this, but the mitogenome of only a few odonates have been annotated. Herein, we report the complete mitogenome of nine odonates, including seven dragonflies and two damselflies, and a comprehensive analysis of the codon usage in 31 Odonata mitogenomes with the aim to estimate their evolutionary characteristics. Overall, a weak codon bias exists among odonate mitogenomes, although this favours AT-ending codons. Damselflies have a weaker codon usage bias than dragonflies, and 37 codons have significantly different usages. Both directional mutation and purifying selection shape damselfly and dragonfly mitogenomes. Although inevitable, directional mutation bias plays a minor role, whereas purifying selection pressure is the dominant evolutionary force. A higher selection pressure is observed in dragonflies than in damselflies, but it mainly acts on codon usage patterns rather than amino acid translation. Our findings suggest that dragonflies might have more efficient mitochondrial gene expression levels than damselflies, producing more proteins that support their locomotion and predatory abilities.},

These roles are linked to the presence of tRNA sequence variants known as isoacceptors and isodecoders, various tRNA base modifications, the versatility of protein binding partners and tRNA fragmentation events, all of which collectively create an incalculable complexity. This complexity provides a vast repertoire of tRNA species that can serve various functions in cellular homeostasis and in adaptation of cellular functions to changing environments, and it likely arose from the fundamental role of RNAs in early evolution.},

We studied here the evolutionary genetics of introduced populations of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata at a worldwide scale. Using microsatellite markers, we reconstructed the main routes of introduction of the species. We found three main routes of introduction, each of them strongly associated to human history and trading routes. We also demonstrate the overwhelming occurrence of male and female clonality in introduced populations of W. auropunctata, and suggest that this particular reproduction system is under selection in human-modified habitats. Together with previous researches focused on native populations, our results suggest that invasive clonal populations may have evolved within human modified habitats in the native range, and spread further from there. The evolutionarily most parsimonious scenario for the emergence of invasive populations of the little fire ant might thus be a two-step process. The W. auropunctata case illustrates the central role of humans in biological change, not only due to changes in migration patterns, but also in selective pressures over species.},

In this study, we present the complete mitogenome of the atlas moth, Attacus atlas (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae), a well-known silk-producing and ornamental insect with the largest wing surface area of all moths. The mitogenome of A. atlas is a circular molecule of 15,282. bp long, and its nucleotide composition shows heavily biased towards As and Ts, accounting for 79.30{\%}. This genome comprises 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and an A. +. T-rich region. It is of note that this genome exhibits a slightly positive AT skew, which is different from the other known Saturniidae species. All PCGs are initiated by ATN codons, except for COI with CGA instead. Only six PCGs use a common stop codon of TAA or TAG, whereas the remaining seven use an incomplete termination codon T or TA. All tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structure, with an exception for tRNASer(AGN). The A. atlas A. +. T-rich region contains non-repetitive sequences, but harbors several features common to the Bombycoidea insects. The phylogenetic relationships based on Maximum Likelihood method provide a well-supported outline of Saturniidae, which is in accordance with the traditional morphological classification and recent molecular works. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The availability of mitochondrial genome sequences is growing as a result of recent technological advances in molecular biology. In phylogenetic analyses, the complete mitogenome is increasingly becoming the marker of choice, usually providing better phylogenetic resolution and precision relative to traditional markers such as cytochrome b (CYTB) and the control region (CR). In some cases, the differences in phylogenetic estimates between mitogenomic and single-gene markers have yielded incongruent conclusions. By comparing phylogenetic estimates made from different genes, we identified the most informative mitochondrial regions and evaluated the minimum amount of data necessary to reproduce the same results as the mitogenome. We compared results among individual genes and the mitogenome for recently published complete mitogenome datasets of selected delphinids (Delphinidae) and killer whales (genus Orcinus). Using Bayesian phylogenetic methods, we investigated differences in estimation of topologies, divergence dates, and clock-like behavior among genes for both datasets. Although the most informative regions were not the same for each taxonomic group (COX1, CYTB, ND3 and ATP6 for Orcinus, and ND1, COX1 and ND4 for Delphinidae), in both cases they were equivalent to less than a quarter of the complete mitogenome. This suggests that gene information content can vary among groups, but can be adequately represented by a portion of the complete sequence. Although our results indicate that complete mitogenomes provide the highest phylogenetic resolution and most precise date estimates, a minimum amount of data can be selected using our approach when the complete sequence is unavailable. Studies based on single genes can benefit from the addition of a few more mitochondrial markers, producing topologies and date estimates similar to those obtained using the entire mitogenome.},

abstract = {Intraspecific variability in social organization is common, yet the underlying causes are rarely known. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a single Mendelian genomic element marked by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene. Here we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social polymorphism, and show that it is part of a pair of heteromorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approximately 13 megabases (55{\%} of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9 megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination.},

abstract = {Spider venoms are rich cocktails of bioactive peptides, proteins, and enzymes that are being intensively investigated over the years. In order to provide a better comprehension of that richness, we propose a three-level family classification system for spider venom components. This classification is supported by an exhaustive set of 219 new profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) able to attribute a given peptide to its precise peptide type, family, and group. The proposed classification has the advantages of being totally independent from variable spider taxonomic names and can easily evolve. In addition to the new classifiers, we introduce and demonstrate the efficiency of hmmcompete, a new standalone tool that monitors HMM-based family classification and, after post-processing the result, reports the best classifier when multiple models produce significant scores towards given peptide queries. The combined used of hmmcompete and the new spider venom component-specific classifiers demonstrated 96{\%} sensitivity to properly classify all known spider toxins from the UniProtKB database. These tools are timely regarding the important classification needs caused by the increasing number of peptides and proteins generated by transcriptomic projects.},

abstract = {Eusocial behavior has arisen in few animal groups, most notably in the aculeate Hymenoptera, a clade comprising ants, bees, and stinging wasps [1-4]. Phylogeny is crucial to understanding the evolution of the salient features of these insects, including eusociality [5]. Yet the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of aculeate Hymenoptera remain contentious [6-12]. We address this problem here by generating and analyzing genomic data for a representative series of taxa. We obtain a single well-resolved and strongly supported tree, robust to multiple methods of phylogenetic inference. Apoidea (spheciform wasps and bees) and ants are sister groups, a novel finding that contradicts earlier views that ants are closer to ectoparasitoid wasps. Vespid wasps (paper wasps, yellow jackets, and relatives) are sister to all other aculeates except chrysidoids. Thus, all eusocial species of Hymenoptera are contained within two major groups, characterized by transport of larval provisions and nest construction, likely prerequisites for the evolution of eusociality. These two lineages are interpolated among three other clades of wasps whose species are predominantly ectoparasitoids on concealed hosts, the inferred ancestral condition for aculeates [2]. This phylogeny provides a new framework for exploring the evolution of nesting, feeding, and social behavior within the stinging Hymenoptera. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

With 55 000 entries in the Protein Data Bank and about 500 new structures added each week, automated processing, comparison, and classification are necessary. A variety of methods use different representations, scoring functions, and optimization algorithms, and they generate contradictory results even for moderately distant structures. Sequence mutations, insertions, and deletions are accommodated by plastic deformations of the common core, retaining the precise geometry of the active site, and peripheral regions may refold completely. Therefore structure comparison methods that allow for flexibility and plasticity generate the most biologically meaningful alignments.

abstract = {Research that connects the effects of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem services is lacking. Ants perform multifarious ecological functions that stabilize ecosystems and contribute to a number of ecosystem services. We studied responses of ant communities to urbanization in the Lake Tahoe basin by sampling sites along a gradient of urban land development. We sampled ant communities, measured vegetation characteristics, quantified human activities, and evaluated ant-community responses by grouping ants into service-providing units (SPUs), defined as a group of organisms and their populations that perform specific ecosystem services, to provide an understanding of urbanization impacts on biodiversity and their delivery of ecosystem services. Species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate levels of urban development, as did the richness of 3 types of ant SPUs (aerators, decomposers, and compilers). With increasing land development aerator and decomposer ants significantly declined in abundance, whereas compiler ants significantly increased in abundance. Competing models demonstrated that precipitation was frequently among the strongest influences on ant community structure; however, urban development and human activities also had a strong, negative influence on ants, appearing in most models with DeltaAIC(c) {\textless}2 for species richness and abundance patterns of SPUs and generalists. Response diversity was observed within SPUs, which suggests that the corresponding ecosystem services were maintained until development reached 30-40{\%}. Our data provide evidence that ecosystem functions, such as water infiltration and soil productivity, may be diminished at sites subject to greater levels of urbanization and that conserving ant communities and the ecosystem services they provide could be an important target in land-use planning and conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Here we describe the mitochondrial genome of the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei, an Asian bivalve which has become one of the most aggressive invasive species in Japan and South America. The mitochondrial genome of L. fortunei does not present conserved gene arrangement when compared to the other Mytilidae species suggesting a high degree of gene recombination in the mitochondria of this clade. In addition, the golden mussel mitogenome encodes two copies of tRNALys and presents a putative pseudogene for the atp8 gene sequence that encodes a 27 amino acid peptide containing an in-frame stop codon. The presence of this pseudogene raises the question as to whether atp8 is encoded in some bivalve mitochondrial genomes or not. The phylogenetic analysis of all complete mitochondrial genomes available from Mytilidae mussels confirmed the close evolutionary relationships among bivalves from the genus Mytilys and placed L. fortunei coming from a more ancestral branch on the family. The supermatrix phylogeny described used the concatenation of all 12 genes from the mitochondria and disputed the monophyly of the genus Perna, as Perna perna was shown to be more closely related to Brachidontes exustus than to Perna viridis. The comparative analysis of mitogenome synteny also confirmed the polyphyly of the genus Perna. The complete and annotated mitogenome has been published in GenBank under the accession number KP756905.},

Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

To evaluate the worldwide spread of W. auropunctata, I compiled published and unpublished specimen records from {\textgreater}1700 sites. I documented the earliest known W. auropunctata records for 53 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major West Indian islands, and US states), including many with no previously published records: Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Caicos Islands, El Salvador, Guam, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Martin, and Texas. In the New World, W. auropunctata has a seemingly continuous distribution from central Argentina to southernmost Texas, suggesting that it may be native throughout this expanse. Wasmannia auropunctata has also spread throughout the West Indies and to peninsular Florida, though it is unclear which West Indian islands may constitute part of its native range. The earliest Old World reports of W. auropunctata, in the 1890's, came from West Africa: Sierra Leone and Gabon. Although no additional records have come from Sierra Leone, W. auropunctata has spread broadly across Gabon and into neighboring countries, where it is a serious pest. In Oceania, the earliest records of W. auropunctata date to 1972 from New Caledonia and 1974 from the Solomon Islands. Pacific populations of W. auropunctata are actively spread- ing within these islands and to many other island groups. In the past decade, first records of W. auropunc- tata have been reported from several Old World areas, including the Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Guam, Italy, and Israel.

In this study we build upon previous shorebird phylogenies to construct the first sequence-based species-level phylogeny for the Scolopaci, one of three shorebird suborders. We sampled 84 species in the Scolopaci, and collected data for five genes (one nuclear and four mitochondrial) via PCR and sequencing or from GenBank. The phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian inference on a partitioned dataset of 6365 aligned base pairs, and was well-supported except for the radiations within Tringa and Calidris. The shanks and phalaropes are sister to the snipes, woodcocks and dowitchers, which in turn are sister to the sandpipers. The godwits and curlews are successive sister-groups to these clades, and the morphologically disparate taxa (jacanas, painted snipes, seedsnipes, and the Plains-wanderer) are the basal sister-group in the Scolopaci. We show that Tringa, Gallinago, and Calidris are paraphyletic assemblages, and thus are in need of taxonomic revision. The clade of Calidridine sandpipers has very short internal branches indicative of a relatively recent rapid radiation, and will require a gene tree/species tree approach to resolve relationships among species. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Exome sequencing is one of the most cost-efficient sequencing approaches for conducting genome research on coding regions. However, significant portions of the reads obtained in exome sequencing come from outside of the designed target regions. These additional reads are generally ignored, potentially wasting an important source of genomic data. There are three major types of unintentionally sequenced read that can be found in exome sequencing data: reads in introns and intergenic regions, reads in the mitochondrial genome, and reads originating in viral genomes. All of these can be used for reliable data mining, extending the utility of exome sequencing. Large-scale exome sequencing data repositories, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the 1000 Genomes Project, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project, and The Sequence Reads Archive, provide researchers with excellent secondary data-mining opportunities to study genomic data beyond the intended target regions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Venom has been associated with the ecological success of many groups of organisms, most notably reptiles, gastropods, and arachnids. In some cases, diversification has been directly linked to tailoring of venoms for dietary specialization. Spiders in particular are known for their diverse venoms and wide range of predatory behaviors, although there is much to learn about scales of variation in venom composition and function. The current study focuses on venom characteristics in different sexes within a species of spider. We chose the genus Tetragnatha (Tetragnathidae) because of its unusual courtship behavior involving interlocking of the venom delivering chelicerae (i.e., the jaws), and several species in the genus are already known to have sexually dimorphic venoms. Here, we use transcriptome and proteome analyses to identify venom components that are dimorphic in Tetragnatha versicolor. We present cDNA sequences including unique, male-specific high molecular weight proteins that have remote, if any, detectable similarity to known venom components in spiders or other venomous lineages and have no detectable homologs in existing databases. While the function of these proteins is not known, their presence in association with the cheliceral locking mechanism during mating together with the presence of prolonged male-male mating attempts in a related, cheliceral-locking species (Doryonychus raptor) lacking the dimorphism suggests potential for a role in sexual communication.},

Enforcement of open-data policies, however, largely relies on manual efforts, which invariably lag behind the increasingly automated generation of biological data. To address this problem, we developed a general approach to automatically identify datasets overdue for public release by applying text mining to identify dataset references in published articles and parse query results from repositories to determine if the datasets remain private. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on 2 popular National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repositories: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Our Wide-Open system identified a large number of overdue datasets, which spurred administrators to respond directly by releasing 400 datasets in one week.},

Rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing technology and the simultaneous development of bioinformatic tools have democratized the field. It is now within reach for individual research groups in the eco-evolutionary and conservation community to generate de novo draft genome sequences for any organism of choice. Because of the cost and considerable effort involved in such an endeavour, the important first step is to thoroughly consider whether a genome sequence is necessary for addressing the biological question at hand. Once this decision is taken, a genome project requires careful planning with respect to the organism involved and the intended quality of the genome draft. Here, we briefly review the state of the art within this field and provide a step-by-step introduction to the workflow involved in genome sequencing, assembly and annotation with particular reference to large and complex genomes. This tutorial is targeted at scientists with a background in conservation genetics, but more generally, provides useful practical guidance for researchers engaging in whole-genome sequencing projects.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Motivation: The NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) promises great biological insight if one could analyze the data in the aggregate; however, the data remain largely underutilized, in part, due to the poor structure of the metadata associated with each sample. The rules governing submissions to the SRA do not dictate a standardized set of terms that should be used to describe the biological samples from which the sequencing data are derived. As a result, the metadata include many synonyms, spelling variants, and references to outside sources of information. Furthermore, manual annotation of the data remains intractable due to the large number of samples in the archive. For these reasons, it has been difficult to perform large-scale analyses that study the relationships between biomolecular processes and phenotype across diverse diseases, tissues, and cell types present in the SRA. Results: We present MetaSRA, a database of normalized SRA sample-specific metadata following a schema inspired by the metadata organization of the ENCODE project. This schema involves mapping samples to terms in biomedical ontologies, labeling each sample with a sample-type category, and extracting real-valued properties. We automated these tasks via a novel computational pipeline. Availability: The MetaSRA database is available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/metasra. Software implementing our computational pipeline is available at https://github.com/deweylab/metasra-pipeline.},

The three West Indian islands with L. coecus populations are all continental shelf islands that were connected to South America during periods of lower sea levels a few thousand years ago, so L. coecus populations on these islands have only recently become isolated. Labidus coecus commonly nests in caves, a microhabitat that may allow it to live in regions with otherwise inhospitable climates.

Transcriptomic profiles have been used to elucidate components of animal venom, since they are capable of providing molecular information on the biology of the animal and could have biomedical applications. In this study, we elucidated the transcriptomic profile of the venom glands from two different freshwater stingray species that are endemic to the Paran{\'{a}}-Paraguay basin in Brazil, Potamotrygon amandae and Potamotrygon falkneri. Using RNA-Seq, we identified species-specific transcripts and overlapping proteins in the venom gland of both species. Among the transcripts related with envenoming, high abundance of hyaluronidases was observed in both species. In addition, we built three-dimensional homology models based on several venom transcripts identified. Our study represents a significant improvement in the information about the venoms employed by these two species and their molecular characteristics. Moreover, the information generated by our group helps in a better understanding of the biology of freshwater cartilaginous fishes and offers clues for the development of clinical treatments for stingray envenoming in Brazil and around the world. Finally, our results might have biomedical implications in developing treatments for complex diseases.},

Trapping was conducted using a transect through a macadamia orchard on the island of Hawaii. The transect consisted of a series of three-tree plots, each plot contained a peanut butter coated stick (the most common detection method used for W. auropunctata in Hawaii), a one-way trap treated with 2-MeBu-diMePy, and a piece of double-sided tape treated with 2-MeBu-diMePy. While there were no differences in the number of W. auropunctata counted with each detection method, and no differences in detection reliability (detecting the known presence of W. auropunctata in a plot), the pheromone-incorporating methods showed greater species specificity, retaining W. auropunctata almost exclusively. These results demonstrate the potential of pheromone-detection methods to selectively capture target ant species even when other ants are present and abundant. Combined data from all three detection methods and a previous visual survey along the transect showed a marked difference in the frequency of cohabitation among ant species. Of the 10 ant species collected, W. auropunctata was found as the sole ant species on a given tree at a significantly higher frequency than all other ant species except Pheidole fervens. 94{\%} percent of the trees with W. auropunctata had only W. auropunctata, supporting previous observations that this species tends to displace other ant species. In addition, W. auropunctata microhabitat preferences were investigated using one-way traps containing 2-MeBu-diMePy, which were placed in three arboreal and three non-arboreal locations. While the number of ants captured did not differ by trap placement, when grouped, captures were significantly higher in arboreal than non-arboreal microhabitats.},

abstract = {Native to the Neotropics, Wasmannia auropunctata has spread to numerous other tropical and subtropical areas, where it is can reach extremely high densities and threaten the local biota. To evaluate the worldwide spread of W. auropunctata, I compiled published and unpublished specimen records from {\textgreater} 1700 sites. I documented the earliest known W. auropunctata records for 53 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major West Indian islands, and US states), including many with no previously published records: Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Caicos Islands, El Salvador, Guam, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Martin, and Texas. In the New World, W. auropunctata has a seemingly continuous distribution from central Argentina to southernmost Texas, suggesting that it may be native throughout this expanse. Wasmannia auropunctata has also spread throughout the West Indies and to peninsular Florida, though it is unclear which West Indian islands may constitute part of its native range. The earliest Old World reports of W. auropunctata, in the 1890's, came from West Africa: Sierra Leone and Gabon. Although no additional records have come from Sierra Leone, W. auropunctata has spread broadly across Gabon and into neighboring countries, where it is a serious pest. In Oceania, the earliest records of W. auropunctata date to 1972 from New Caledonia and 1974 from the Solomon Islands. Pacific populations of W. auropunctata are actively spread- ing within these islands and to many other island groups. In the past decade, first records of W. auropunc- tata have been reported from several Old World areas, including the Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Guam, Italy, and Israel. Wasmannia auropunctata appears to still have much potential for future spread in the Old World.},

Individuals of both subspecies made long, usually non-stop, flights from non-breeding grounds to coastal staging grounds in the Yellow Sea region of East Asia (average 10 060 ± SD 290 km for baueri and 5860 ± 240 km for menzbieri). After an average stay of 41.2 ± 4.8 d, baueri flew over the North Pacific Ocean before heading northeast to the Alaskan breeding grounds (6770 ± 800 km). Menzbieri staged for 38.4 ± 2.5 d, and flew over land and sea northeast to high arctic Russia (4170 ± 370 km). The post-breeding journey for baueri involved several weeks of staging in southwest Alaska followed by non-stop flights across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand (11 690 km in a complete track) or stopovers on islands in the southwestern Pacific en route to New Zealand and eastern Australia. By contrast, menzbieri returned to Australia via stopovers in the New Siberian Islands, Russia, and back at the Yellow Sea; birds travelled on average 4510 ± 360 km from Russia to the Yellow Sea, staged there for 40.8 ± 5.6 d, and then flew another 5680?7180 km to Australia (10 820 ± 300 km in total). Overall, the entire migration of the single baueri godwit with a fully completed return track totalled 29 280 km and involved 20 d of major migratory flight over a round-trip journey of 174 d. The entire migrations of menzbieri averaged 21 940 ± 570 km, including 14 d of major migratory flights out of 154 d total. Godwits of both populations exhibit extreme flight performance, and baueri makes the longest (southbound) and second-longest (northbound) non-stop migratory flights documented for any bird. Both subspecies essentially make single stops when moving between non-breeding and breeding sites in opposite hemispheres. This reinforces the critical importance of the intertidal habitats used by fuelling godwits in Australasia, the Yellow Sea, and Alaska.},

abstract = {In the annual cycle of migratory birds, temporal and energetic constraints can lead to carry-over effects, in which performance in one life history stage affects later stages. Bar-tailed godwits Limosa lapponica baueri, which achieve remarkably high pre-migratory fuel loads, undertake the longest non-stop migratory flights yet recorded, and breed during brief high-latitude summers, may be particularly vulnerable to persistent effects of disruptions to their rigidly-timed annual routines. Using three years of non-breeding data in New Zealand, we asked how arrival timing after a non-stop flight from Alaska ({\textgreater}11 000 km) affected an individual godwit's performance in subsequent flight feather moult, contour feather moults, and migratory departure. Late arrival led to later wing moult, but godwits partially compensated for delayed moult initiation by increasing moult rate and decreasing the total duration of moult. Delays in arrival and wing moult up to 3437 d had no apparent effect on an individual's migratory departure or extent of breeding plumage at departure, both of which were extraordinarily consistent between years. Thus, errors in timing early in the non-breeding season were essentially corrected in New Zealand prior to spring migration. Variation in migration timing also had no apparent effect on an individual's likelihood of returning the following season. The bar-tailed godwits rigid maintenance of plumage and spring migration schedules, coupled with high annual survival, imply a surprising degree of flexibility to address unforeseen circumstances in the annual cycle.},

abstract = {Ants are among the most ubiquitous and harmful invaders worldwide, but there are few regional studies of their relationships with habitat and native ant communities. New Caledonia has a unique and diverse ant fauna that is threatened by exotic ants, but broad-scale patterns of exotic and native ant community composition in relation to habitat remain poorly documented. We conducted a systematic baiting survey of 56 sites representing the main New Caledonian habitat types: rainforest on ultramafic soils (15 sites), rainforest on volcano-sedimentary soils (13), maquis shrubland (15), Melaleuca-dominated savannas (11) and Acacia spirorbis thickets (2). We collected a total of 49 species, 13 of which were exotic. Only five sites were free of exotic species, and these were all rainforest. The five most abundant exotic species differed in their habitat association, with Pheidole megacephala associated with rainforests, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior with savanna, and Wasmannia auropunctata and Nylanderia vaga present in most habitats. Anoplolepis gracilipes occurred primarily in maquis-shrubland, which contrasts with its rainforest affinity elsewhere. Multivariate analysis of overall ant species composition showed strong differentiation of sites according to the distribution of exotic species, and these patterns were maintained at the genus and functional group levels. Native ant composition differed at invaded versus uninvaded rainforest sites, in the absence of differences in habitat variables. Generalised Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were particularly affected by invasion. There was a strong negative relationship between the abundance of W. auropunctata and native ant abundance and richness. This emphasizes that, in addition to dominating many ant communities numerically, some exotic species, and in particular W. auropunctata, have a marked impact on native ant communities.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing projects were long confined to biomedical model organisms and required the concerted effort of large consortia. Rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing technology and the simultaneous development of bioin-formatic tools have democratized the field. It is now within reach for individual research groups in the eco-evolutionary and conservation community to generate de novo draft genome sequences for any organism of choice. Because of the cost and considerable effort involved in such an endeavour, the important first step is to thoroughly consider whether a genome sequence is necessary for addressing the biological question at hand. Once this decision is taken, a genome project requires careful planning with respect to the organism involved and the intended quality of the genome draft. Here, we briefly review the state of the art within this field and provide a step-by-step introduction to the workflow involved in gen-ome sequencing, assembly and annotation with particular reference to large and complex genomes. This tutorial is targeted at scientists with a background in con-servation genetics, but more generally, provides useful practical guidance for researchers engaging in whole-genome sequencing projects.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics and altered the scientific publication landscape. Life-science journals abound with genome papers-peer-reviewed descriptions of newly sequenced chromosomes. Although they once filled the pages of Nature and Science, genome papers are now mostly relegated to journals with low-impact factors. Some have forecast the death of the genome paper and argued that they are using up valuable resources and not advancing science. However, the publication rate of genome papers is on the rise. This increase is largely because some journals have created a new category of manuscript called genome reports, which are short, fast-tracked papers describing a chromosome sequence(s), its GenBank accession number and little else. In 2015, for example, more than 2000 genome reports were published, and 2016 is poised to bring even more. Here, I highlight the growing popularity of genome reports and discuss their merits, drawbacks and impact on science and the academic publication infrastructure. Genome reports can be excellent assets for the research community, but they are also being used as quick and easy routes to a publication , and in some instances they are not peer reviewed. One of the best arguments for genome reports is that they are a citable, user-generated genomic resource providing essential methodological and biological information, which may not be present in the sequence database. But they are expensive and time-consuming avenues for achieving such a goal. Birth of the genome paper Nearly four decades ago, Sanger et al. [1] decoded, for the first time, the entire DNA sequence of a genome, that of the bacterio-phage UX174. This historic achievement also marked the inception of a new genre of scientific article: the genome paper. It would take another 4 years before scientists sequenced and published a human chromosome-our mitochondrial genome [2]-and an additional 15 years for the arrival of a nuclear gen-ome paper (yeast) [3]. These and other pioneering genome sequences , such as that of Haemophilus influenzae [4], had a massive and lasting impact on life-science research. The human mitochondrial genome paper [2], for example, has been cited more than 8000 times. By the turn of the millennium, genome papers were fast becoming among the most publicized and cited articles within the scientific literature. The simultaneously published articles describing the human genome [5, 6] topped Thomson Reuters' Science Watch list of 'hot papers' in biology of 2001 [7]. These same articles were also widely covered by scientific and popular news media, which has become a recurring theme for genome papers of all stripes. Just think of all the university press releases , journal editorials and news stories that you have read David Roy Smith is an assistant professor of biology at the University of Western Ontario.

abstract = {Background: Spiders (Order Araneae) are essential predators in every terrestrial ecosystem largely because they have evolved potent arsenals of silk and venom. Spider silks are high performance materials made almost entirely of proteins, and thus represent an ideal system for investigating genome level evolution of novel protein functions. However, genomic level resources remain limited for spiders. Results: We de novo assembled a transcriptome for the Western black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) from deeply sequenced cDNAs of three tissue types. Our multi-tissue assembly contained {\~{}}100,000 unique transcripts, of which {\textgreater} 27,000 were annotated by homology. Comparing transcript abundance among the different tissues, we identified 647 silk gland-specific transcripts, including the few known silk fiber components (e.g. six spider fibroins, spidroins). Silk gland specific transcripts are enriched compared to the entire transcriptome in several functions, including protein degradation, inhibition of protein degradation, and oxidation-reduction. Phylogenetic analyses of 37 gene families containing silk gland specific transcripts demonstrated novel gene expansions within silk glands, and multiple co-options of silk specific expression from paralogs expressed in other tissues. Conclusions: We propose a transcriptional program for the silk glands that involves regulating gland specific synthesis of silk fiber and glue components followed by protecting and processing these components into functional fibers and glues. Our black widow silk gland gene repertoire provides extensive expansion of resources for biomimetic applications of silk in industry and medicine. Furthermore, our multi-tissue transcriptome facilitates evolutionary analysis of arachnid genomes and adaptive protein systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Clarke et al.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are generally thought to occur after human aided migration to a new range. However, human activities prior to migration may also play a role. We studied here the evolutionary genetics of introduced populations of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata at a worldwide scale. Using microsatellite markers, we reconstructed the main routes of introduction of the species. We found three main routes of introduction, each of them strongly associated to human history and trading routes. We also demonstrate the overwhelming occurrence of male and female clonality in introduced populations of W. auropunctata, and suggest that this particular reproduction system is under selection in human-modified habitats. Together with previous researches focused on native populations, our results suggest that invasive clonal populations may have evolved within human modified habitats in the native range, and spread further from there. The evolutionarily most parsimonious scenario for the emergence of invasive populations of the little fire ant might thus be a two-step process. The W. auropunctata case illustrates the central role of humans in biological change, not only due to changes in migration patterns, but also in selective pressures over species.},

Despite near universal recognition of its importance, major barriers still exist to sharing raw data, software, and research products throughout the scientific community. Many of these barriers vary by specialty [1], increasing the difficulties for interdisciplinary and/or translational researchers to engage in collaborative research. Multi-site collaborations are vital for increasing both the impact and the generalizability of research results. However, they often present unique data sharing challenges. We discuss enabling multi-site collaborations through enhanced data sharing in this set of Ten Simple Rules. Collaboration is an essential component of research [2] that takes many forms, including internal (across departments within a single institution) and external collaborations (across institutions). However, multi-site collaborations with more than two institutions encounter more complex challenges because of institutional-specific restrictions and guidelines [3]. Vicens and Bourne focus on collaborators working together on a shared research grant [4]. They do not discuss the specific complexities of multi-site collaborations and the vital need for enhanced data sharing in the multi-site and large-scale collaboration context, in which partici-pants may or may not have the same funding source and/or research grant. While challenging, multi-site collaborations are equally rewarding and result in increased research productivity [5, 6].

abstract = {New generation sequencing platforms are producing data with significantly higher throughput and lower cost. A portion of this capacity is devoted to individual and community scientific projects. As these projects reach publication, raw sequencing datasets are submitted into the primary next-generation sequence data archive, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Archiving experimental data is the key to the progress of reproducible science. The SRA was established as a public repository for next-generation sequence data as a part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). INSDC is composed of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The SRA is accessible at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra from NCBI, at www.ebi.ac.uk/ena from EBI and at trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp from DDBJ.

abstract = {Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have greatly improved our ability to detect genomic variants for biomedical research. In particular, NGS technologies have been recently applied with great success to the discovery of mutations associated with the growth of various tumours and in rare Mendelian diseases. The advance in NGS technologies has also created significant challenges in bioinformatics. One of the major challenges is quality control of the sequencing data. In this review, we discuss the proper quality control procedures and parameters for Illumina technology-based human DNA re-sequencing at three different stages of sequencing: raw data, alignment and variant calling. Monitoring quality control metrics at each of the three stages of NGS data provides unique and independent evaluations of data quality from differing perspectives. Properly conducting quality control protocols at all three stages and correctly interpreting the quality control results are crucial to ensure a successful and meaningful study.},

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journalScienceafter the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44{\%} of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26{\%}. We find this policy-author remission of data and code postpublication upon request-an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.},

Almost all outdoor records of Technomyrmex difficilis are from tropical areas, extending into the subtropics only in Madagascar, South Africa, the southeastern US, and the Bahamas. In addition, there are several indoor records of T. dif- ficilis from greenhouses at zoos and botanical gardens in temperate parts of the US. Over the past few years, T. difficilis has become a dominant arboreal ant at numerous sites in Florida and the West Indies. Unfortunately, T. difficilis ap- pears to be able to invade intact forest habitats, where it can more readily impact native species. It is likely that in the coming years, T. difficilis will become increasingly more important as a pest in Florida and the West Indies.},

The average number of nucleotide differences (ANND) was established to be 10.2 for the complete D-loop. The majority of sequence variations were substitutions, particularly transitions. Deletions were found only in the region where HV3 is situated and insertions in the same place and in poly-C tracts between positions 303 and 315 in HV2. A high degree of length heteroplasmy was found especially in the regions of poly-C tracts between positions 16184 and 16193 in HV1 and between positions 303 and 315 in HV2.

Understanding mtDNA organization and inheritance is therefore an important goal.

In addition, components of a membrane-associated mtDNA segregation apparatus that might link mtDNA transmission to mitochondrial movements are beginning to be identified. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of mtDNA maintenance and inheritance.},

abstract = {Cardiocondyla spp. are small, inconspicuous ants, native to the Old World. Until recently, Cardiocondyla mauritanica Forel, 1890 was a little known species recorded almost exclusively from the semi-arid subtropics of North Africa, the Middle East, and neighboring islands. In contrast, Cardiocondyla nuda Mayr, 1866 was considered a cosmopolitan tramp species, spread broadly around the world through human commerce. A recent taxonomic reanalysis by B. Seifert, however, found genuine C. nuda restricted to Australia, New Guinea, and Western Oceania, and that published records of ‘C. nuda' from outside this region were based on misidentifications of other species, notably C. mauritanica. In addition, Cardiocondyla ectopia, known from North America, was found to be a junior synonym of C. mauritanica. Here, I examine the worldwide spread of C. mauritanica. I compiled published and unpublished C. mauritanica specimen records from {\textgreater}250 sites, documenting the earliest known records for 47 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major islands, and US states), including sev- eral for which I found no previously published records: Barbados, Bonaire, Cura{\c{c}}ao, Grenada, Saba, and Saudi Arabia. Cardiocondyla mauritanica is found primarily in semi-arid and urban environments. Cardiocondyla mauritanica shows an apparently continuous distribution and geographic variation in morphology from northwest Africa to India suggesting that C. mauritanica is native throughout this subtropical expanse. Old World records of C. mauritanica far from this range come from Ascension, Zimbabwe, and several Indo-Pacific islands. Te sole temperate record of C. mauritanica comes from Ukraine. Cardiocondyla mauritanica was first found in the New World in 1967, and has spread through the southwestern US, northern Mexico, Florida, and the West Indies. Part of the success of C. mauritanica in exotic locales may relate to its ability to co-exist with dominant invasive ants, such as the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr, 1868).},

The secret to their success lies in the evolution of queen (reproductive) and worker (provisioner and carer) castes (Oster {\&} Wilson ). A major problem in evolutionary biology is explaining the evolution of insect castes, particularly the workers (Darwin ). Next-generation sequencing technologies now make it possible to understand how genomic material is born, lost and reorganized in the evolution of alternative phenotypes. Such analyses are revealing a general role for novel (e.g. taxonomically restricted) genes in phenotypic innovations across the animal kingdom (Chen et al. 2013). In this issue of molecular ecology, Feldmeyer et al. (2014) provide overwhelming evidence for the importance of novel genes in caste evolution in an ant. Feldmeyer et al.'s study is important and exciting because it cements the role of genomic novelty, as well as conservation, firmly into the molecular jigsaw of social evolution. Evolution is eclectic in its exploitation of both old and new genomic material to generate replicated phenotypic innovations across the tree of life.},

abstract = {Gaining a genomic perspective on phylogeny requires the collection of data from many putatively independent loci collected across the genome. Among insects, an increasingly common approach to collecting this class of data involves transcriptome sequencing, because few insects have high-quality genome sequences available; assembling new genomes remains a limiting factor; the transcribed portion of the genome is a reasonable, reduced subset of the genome to target; and the data collected from transcribed portions of the genome are similar in composition to the types of data with which biologists have traditionally worked (e.g., exons). However, molecular techniques requiring RNA as a template, including transcriptome sequencing, are limited to using very high quality source materials, which are often unavailable from a large proportion of biologically important insect samples. Recent research suggests that DNA-based target enrichment of conserved genomic elements offers another path to collecting phylogenomic data across insect taxa, provided that conserved elements are present in and can be collected from insect genomes. Here, we identify a large set (n=1,510) of ultraconserved elements (UCE) shared among the insect order Hymenoptera. We use in silico analyses to show that these loci accurately reconstruct relationships among genome-enabled Hymenoptera, and we design a set of baits for enriching these loci that researchers can use with DNA templates extracted from a variety of sources. We use our UCE bait set to enrich an average of 721 UCE loci from 30 hymenopteran taxa, and we use these UCE loci to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships spanning very old (≥220 MYA) to very young (≥1 MYA) divergences among hymenopteran lineages. In contrast to a recent study addressing hymenopteran phylogeny using transcriptome data, we found ants to be sister to all remaining aculeate lineages with complete support. We discuss this approach and our results in the context of elucidating the evolutionary history of one of the most diverse and speciose animal orders.},

abstract = {Ants are among the most ubiquitous and harmful invaders worldwide, but there are few regional studies of their relationships with habitat and native ant communities. New Caledonia has a unique and diverse ant fauna that is threatened by exotic ants, but broad-scale patterns of exotic and native ant community composition in relation to habitat remain poorly documented. We conducted a systematic baiting survey of 56 sites representing the main New Caledonian habitat types: rainforest on ultramafic soils (15 sites), rainforest on volcano-sedimentary soils (13), maquis shrubland (15), Melaleuca-dominated savannas (11) and Acacia spirorbis thickets (2). We collected a total of 49 species, 13 of which were exotic. Only five sites were free of exotic species, and these were all rainforest. The five most abundant exotic species differed in their habitat association, with Pheidole megacephala associated with rainforests, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior with savanna, and Wasmannia auropunctata and Nylanderia vaga present in most habitats. Anoplolepis gracilipes occurred primarily in maquis-shrubland, which contrasts with its rainforest affinity elsewhere. Multivariate analysis of overall ant species composition showed strong differentiation of sites according to the distribution of exotic species, and these patterns were maintained at the genus and functional group levels. Native ant composition differed at invaded versus uninvaded rainforest sites, in the absence of differences in habitat variables. Generalised Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were particularly affected by invasion. There was a strong negative relationship between the abundance of W. auropunctata and native ant abundance and richness. This emphasizes that, in addition to dominating many ant communities numerically, some exotic species, and in particular W. auropunctata, have a marked impact on native ant communities.},

abstract = {Although conspicuous and well-studied, stag beetles have been slow to join the genomic era. In this study, mitochondrial genomes of two stag beetles, Sinodendron yunnanense and Prosopocoilus confucius, are sequenced for the first time. Both of their genomes consisted of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and a control region. The mitogenome of S. yunnanense was 16,921 bp in length, and P. confucius was 16,951 bp. The location of the gene trnL(UUR), between the A + T-rich and control region in S. yunnanense, is the first observed in Lucanidae. In P. confucius, an unexpected noncoding region of 580 bp was discovered. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference on the 13 mitochondrial PCGs were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among 12 representative stag beetles and three scarab beetles. The topology of the two phylogenetic trees was almost identical: S. yunnanense was recovered as the most basal Lucanid, and the genus Prosopocoilus was polyphyletic due to P. gracilis being recovered sister to the genera Dorcus and Hemisodorcus. The phylogenetic results, genetic distances and mitogenomic characteristics call into question the cohesion of the genus Prosopocoilus. The genetic resources and findings herein attempts to redress understudied systematics and mitogenomics of the stag beetles.},

abstract = {The phorid fly, Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier, is a parasitoid of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren. This fly has been reported to use fire ant chemicals, specifically venom alkaloids and possibly alarm pheromone to locate its host. A recent study identified 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethyl pyrazine as a component of the alarm pheromone of S. invicta. To determine the possible involvement of this fire ant alarm pheromone component in mediating fire ant-phorid fly interactions, we tested electroantennogram (EAG) and behavioral responses of P. tricuspis females to the commercially available mixture of 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethyl pyrazine and its 3,5-dimethyl isomer, as well as six structurally related alkylpyrazine analogs at varying doses. Pseudacteon tricuspis females showed significant EAG response to 2-ethyl-3,6(or 5)-dimethyl pyrazine (herein referred to as pheromone-isomer) at all doses, 0.001-10 {\$}\mu{\$}g. Among the tested alkylpyrazine analogs, 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine showed significant EAG activity at 0.1 and 1 {\$}\mu{\$}g. 2,3-dimethyl pyrazine also showed significant EAG activity at 0.1 {\$}\mu{\$}g. Results of four-choice olfactometer bioassays demonstrated significant attraction of P. tricuspis females to the pheromone-isomer (2-ethyl-3,6(or 5)-dimethyl pyrazine) at all tested doses (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 {\$}\mu{\$}g). The analogs, 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine and 2,3-dimethyl pyrazine were significantly better than the control at the higher doses (0.1, 1 and 10 {\$}\mu{\$}g). The pheromone-isomer was significantly better than both analogs at two doses, 0.1 and 1 {\$}\mu{\$}g. These results confirm that the reported fire ant alarm pheromone component plays a role in mediating attraction of phorid flies to host workers. Venom alkaloids were previously shown to attract P. tricuspis; therefore, we propose that fire ant alarm pheromones may act in tandem or synergistically with venom alkaloids to attract phorid fly parasitoids to fire ant workers. {\textcopyright}2011.},

Pachycondyla harpax is also now known from six West Indian islands: Grenada, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Margarita, Trinidad, and Tobago. The known continental range of P. harpax appears to be essentially continuous, extending from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil in the south (31.8°S) to Wood County, Texas in the north (32.8°N), including the continental islands of Margarita, Tobago, and Trinidad. Isolated island populations of P. harpax on Grenada, Guadeloupe, and Jamaica may be exotic, introduced through human commerce.

In this study, we present the most comprehensive analyses of hymenopteran relationships based on 48 mitochondrial (mt) genomes. One complete and two nearly complete mt genomes representing three hymenopteran superfamilies were newly sequenced. We assessed the influence of inclusion/exclusion of 3rd codon positions, alignment approaches, partition schemes and phylogenetic approaches on topology and nodal support within the Hymenoptera. The results showed that the topologies were sensitive to the variation of dataset and analytical approach. However, some robust and highly supported relationships were recovered: the Ichneumonomorpha was monophyletic; the Trigonalyoidea. +. Megalyroidea and the Diaprioidea. +. Chalcidoidea were consistently recovered; the Cynipoidea was generally recovered as the sister group to the Diaprioidea. +. Chalcidoidea. In addition, the monophyletic Aculeata and Proctotrupomorpha were recovered in some analyses. Several gene rearrangements were detected in each of the three newly sequenced mt genomes. Specifically, the Ibalia leucospoides mt genome harbors a large inversion of a gene block from trnE to trnS2. Inverted, duplicated A. +. T rich regions were detected in the Ibalia leucospoides mt genome, which probably played an important role during the formation of the large gene block inversion via recombination.},

abstract = {Ants are one of the most ecologically and numerically dominant group of terrestrial organisms with most species diversity currently found in tropical climates. Several explanations for the disparity of biological diversity in the tropics compared to temperate regions have been proposed including that the tropics may act as a "museum" where older lineages persist through evolutionary time or as a "cradle" where new species continue to be generated. We infer the molecular phylogenetic relationships of 295 ant specimens including members of all 21 extant subfamilies to explore the evolutionary diversification and biogeography of the ants. By constraining the topology and age of the root node while using 45 fossils as minimum constraints, we converge on an age of 139-158 Mya for the modern ants. Further diversification analyses identified 10 periods with a significant change in the tempo of diversification of the ants, although these shifts did not appear to correspond to ancestral biogeographic range shifts. Likelihood-based historical biogeographic reconstructions suggest that the Neotropics were important in early ant diversification (e.g., Cretaceous). This finding coupled with the extremely high-current species diversity suggests that the Neotropics have acted as both a museum and cradle for ant diversity.},

We analysed workers and young nonreproductive queens collected from nests of the monogyne (single reproductive queen per nest) and polygyne (multiple reproductive queens) social forms of Solenopsis invicta. In workers but not young queens, the level of foraging expression was significantly associated with social form and the task performed (ie localization in the nest or foraging area). The level of expression of Gp-9 was also associated with social form and worker localization. In addition there was a higher level of expression of the Gp-9b allele compared with the Gp-9B allele in the heterozygote workers and the young nonreproductive queens. Finally, in the polygyne colonies the level of expression of foraging was not significantly associated with the Gp-9 genotype for either workers or young nonreproductive queens, suggesting that both genes have independent non-epistatic effects on behaviour in S. invicta.},

The molecular basis of such phenotypic plasticity is of great interest to the scientific community. DNA methylation, as well as other epigenetic signals, plays an important role in modulating gene expression and can therefore establish, sustain, and alter organism-level phenotypes, including behavior and life span. Unlike DNA methylation in mammals, DNA methylation in insects, including eusocial insects, is en- riched in gene bodies of actively expressed genes. Recent investigations have revealed the important role of gene body methylation in regulating gene expression in response to intrinsic and environmental factors. In this review, we summarize recent advances in DNA methylation research and discuss its significance in our understanding of the epigenetic underpinnings of behav- ior and longevity.},

To document the worldwide distribution of M. rubra and evaluate its potential for further spread, we compiled published and unpublished specimen records from {\textgreater} 2000 sites. We report the earliest known M rubra records for 71 geographic areas (countries, major islands, US states, Canadian provinces, and Russian federal districts), including three areas with no previously published records: Prince Edward Island, Washington State, and the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia. All earlier published records of M. rubra from East Asia, including the Far East of Russia, Japan, and China, appear to be misidentifications of Myrmica kotokui FOREL, 1911.Myrmica rubra is native to an enormous expanse extending from Ireland and Portugal in westernmost Europe across 8000 km to central Asia and eastern Siberia, and from 39 to 70 degrees N in latitude. Exotic populations of M rubra were first recorded in eastern North America more than 100 years ago. Myrmica rubra is now documented from five southeastern Canadian provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec), six northeastern US states (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont), and one northwestern state (Washington) ranging from 41.5 to 47.6 degrees N.Given the vast range of M rubra in Eurasia, perhaps the most striking aspect about this species in North America is how little it has spread over the past century. Most North American records of M rubra, however, date from the last ten years, suggesting these North American populations are expanding. There appear to be no geographic barriers that would prevent M. rubra from spreading across the US and Canada, from coast to coast.},

Birds, other species of lizards, crocodilians, marsupial mammals, snakes, tuatara, lamprey, and some other amphibians and one species of fish have gene orders that are less conserved. The most probable mechanism for new gene rearrangements seems to be tandem duplication and multiple deletion events, always associated with tRNA sequences. Some new rearrangements seem to be typical of monophyletic groups and the use of data from these groups may be useful for answering phylogenetic questions involving vertebrate higher taxonomic levels. Other features such as the secondary structure of tRNA, and the start and stop codons of protein-coding genes may also be useful in comparisons of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes.},

abstract = {Spider ants of the genus Leptomyrmex Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) are conspicuous species of Australasian rainforests, with putative fossil relatives in the Neotropics and Europe. There is longstanding debate over the biogeographical history of the genus, with the Palaearctic and Neotropical regions proposed as alternate centres of origin.We propose a resolution of this debate with the recent discovery and analysis of an extant species from central Brazil, L. relictus sp.n., whichwe describe fromworkers,males and brood.We sequence ten nuclear genes in the new species and in several Australian Leptomyrmex species, and append these data to a 54-taxon, 10-gene data matrix previously generated for the subfamily Dolichoderinae. We conduct phylogenetic and divergence dating analyses, and re-evaluate the fossil record of the group. We recover Leptomyrmex relictus sp.n. as a member of the Leptomyrmex clade with high support. It is sister to the Australasian species, and the genus Leptomyrmex is, in turn, sister to a pair of Neotropical genera, Forelius and Dorymyrmex. We infer a Neotropical origin for the genus and estimate a mid-Eocene (46Ma, 95{\%} CI 56 to 36 Ma) origin for the crown genus and an Oligocene origin for the Australasian clade (29Ma, 95{\%} CI 40 to 19 Ma). We confirm placement of the Dominican amber species †L. neotropicus Baroni Urbani in the genus but reject a close relationship with the Palaearctic fossil taxa †Leptomyrmula Emery and †Usomyrma Dlussky, Radchenko {\&} Dubovikoff, considering them incertae sedis in the subfamily (Dolichoderinae). In contrast to the mesophilic preferences of the Australasian species of Leptomyrmex, the new Brazilian species inhabits cerrado (dry savannah). Our results support a Neotropical origin for spider ants with dispersal to Australia. Rafting on west-bound currents and/or a historical diversity imbalance between Australia and South America are proposed as alternate hypotheses to explain a pattern of biased E–W mid-Tertiary dispersal for ants with austral distributions. This pattern is suggested by our results in conjunction with observations of other ant clades. Overall, our findings highlight the value of integrated taxonomy, critical interpretation of morphology, and a comparative phylogenetic framework when conducting palaeontological and biogeographical studies of insect species.},

abstract = {We produced estimates of the total number of species currently known and the total numbers predicted to occur in Brazil. Lists of species recorded in Brazilwere obtained from specialists and the literature. For taxa lacking information on total known species, we produced estimates based on bootstrap resampling from a set of 87 taxa with checklists for Brazil and the world. The estimated proportion of Brazilian species was 9.5{\%} of theworld total (95{\%} CI, 8.5 to 11.5{\%}). From thiswe estimated a known Brazilian biota of 170,000 to 210,000 species. We used a similar procedure to estimate Brazil's total biota—known plus undiscovered. Based on 17 relatively well-known taxa, the average Brazilian share in the world's biota was estimated at 13.1{\%} (CI 10.0 to 17.6{\%}). Accordingly we estimated the country's total biota at 1.8 million species (CI 1.4 to 2.4 million). Given that the Neotropics is the least-studied major region of theworld, these figures are still likely to be underestimates and hence may be taken as a lower bound of the actual proportion of the world's species that occur in Brazil. Scientists, policy makers, and citizens will find these numbers useful in appreciating the magnitude of the tasks involved in surveying, describing, and conserving the country's biota. The numbers also bring proposals and priorities into a more realistic perspective.},

abstract = {Vollenhovia emeryi Wheeler is a small and inconspicuous ant species originally from East Asia that recently has been found in North America. Here, we examine the geographic spread of V. emeryi and compare its native range in Asia with its exotic range in North America. We compiled published and unpublished V. emeryi specimen records from {\textgreater}300 sites. We documented the earliest known V. emeryi records for 14 geographic areas, ten in Asia (Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and five provinces of China) and four in North America (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington DC). Reports of V. emeryi from lower latitude (14.3°N to 25.1°N) sites in Taiwan, Thailand, and southern China, however, probably represent a distinct species. Vollenhovia emeryi has a much broader latitudinal spread in East Asia (at least 13.5° range: 29.7°N to 43.2°N) than it has in North America (1.3° range: 38.7°N to 40.0°N). The North American records of V. emeryi are all at latitudes near the northernmost records in Asia. It seems likely that V. emeryi will spread further in North America, particularly towards the south and west.},

abstract = {Motivation: The NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) promises great biological insight if one could analyze the data in the aggregate; however, the data remain largely underutilized, in part, due to the poor structure of the metadata associated with each sample. The rules governing submissions to the SRA do not dictate a standardized set of terms that should be used to describe the biological samples from which the sequencing data are derived. As a result, the metadata include many synonyms, spelling variants, and references to outside sources of information. Furthermore, manual annotation of the data remains intractable due to the large number of samples in the archive. For these reasons, it has been difficult to perform large-scale analyses that study the relationships between biomolecular processes and phenotype across diverse diseases, tissues, and cell types present in the SRA. Results: We present MetaSRA, a database of normalized SRA sample-specific metadata following a schema inspired by the metadata organization of the ENCODE project. This schema involves mapping samples to terms in biomedical ontologies, labeling each sample with a sample-type category, and extracting real-valued properties. We automated these tasks via a novel computational pipeline. Availability: The MetaSRA database is available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/metasra. Software implementing our computational pipeline is available at https://github.com/deweylab/metasra-pipeline.},

abstract = {This paper reviews top-down regulation analysis, a part of metabolic control analysis, and shows how it can be used to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in complex systems such as energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues. A steady state is maintained by the variables in a system; regulation is the way the steady state is changed by external effectors. We can exploit the properties of the steady state to measure the kinetic responses (elasticities) of reactions to the concentrations of intermediates and effectors. We can reduce the complexity of the system under investigation by grouping reactions into large blocks connected by a small number of explicit intermediates-this is the top-down approach to control analysis. Simple titrations then yield all the values of elasticities and control coefficients within the system. We can use these values to quantify the relative strengths of different internal pathways that act to keep an intermediate or a rate constant in the steady state. We can also use them to quantify the relative strengths of different primary actions of an external effector and the different internal pathways that transmit its effects through the system, to describe regulation and homeostasis. This top-down regulation analysis has been used to analyse steady states of energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues, and to analyse regulation of energy metabolism by cadmium, an external effector, in mitochondria. The combination of relatively simple experiments and new theoretical structures for presenting and interpreting the results means that top-down regulation analysis provides a novel and effective way to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in intricate metabolic systems.},

abstract = {Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been successfully used in phylogenomics for a variety of taxa, but their power in phylogenetic inference has yet to be extensively compared with that of traditional Sanger sequencing data sets. Moreover, UCE data on invertebrates, including insects, are sparse. We compared the phylogenetic informativeness of 959 UCE loci with a multi-locus data set of ten nuclear markers obtained via Sanger sequencing, testing the ability of these two types of data to resolve and date the evolutionary history of the second most species-rich subfamily of ants in the world, the Formicinae. Phylogenetic analyses show that UCEs are superior in resolving ancient and shallow relationships in formicine ants, demonstrated by increased node support and a more resolved phylogeny. Phylogenetic informativeness metrics indicate a twofold improvement relative to the 10-gene data matrix generated from the identical set of taxa. We were able to significantly improve formicine classification based on our comprehensive UCE phylogeny. Our divergence age estimations, using both UCE and Sanger data, indicate that crown-group Formicinae are older (104–117 Ma) than previously suggested. Biogeographic analyses infer that the diversification of the subfamily has occurred on all continents with no particular hub of cladogenesis. We found UCEs to be far superior to the multi-locus data set in estimating formicine relationships. The early history of the clade remains uncertain due to ancient rapid divergence events that are unresolvable even with our genomic-scale data, although this might be largely an effect of several problematic taxa subtended by long branches. Our comparison of divergence ages from both Sanger and UCE data demonstrates the effectiveness of UCEs for dating analyses. This comparative study highlights both the promise and limitations of UCEs for insect phylogenomics, and will prove useful to the growing number of evolutionary biologists considering the transition from Sanger to next-generation sequencing approaches.},

abstract = {The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Nemoura nankinensis (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) was sequenced as the first reported mitogenome from the family Nemouridae. The N. nankinensis mitogenome was the longest (16,602 bp) among reported plecopteran mitogenomes, and it contains 37 genes including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Most PCGs used standard ATN as start codons, and TAN as termination codons. All tRNA genes of N. nankinensis could fold into the cloverleaf secondary structures except for trnSer (AGN), whose dihydrouridine (DHU) arm was reduced to a small loop. There was also a large non-coding region (control region, CR) in the N. nankinensis mitogenome. The 1751 bp CR was the longest and had the highest A+T content (81.8{\%}) among stoneflies. A large tandem repeat region, five potential stem-loop (SL) structures, four tRNA-like structures and four conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) were detected in the elongated CR. The presence of these tRNA-like structures in the CR has never been reported in other plecopteran mitogenomes. These novel features of the elongated CR in N. nankinensis may have functions associated with the process of replication and transcription. Finally, phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that Nemouridae was the sister-group of Capniidae.},

abstract = {Spermiogenesis, known as spermateleosis in lower vertebrates, is the transformation of the round spermatid into a highly specialized spermatozoon with a species-specific structure. Spermateleosis and sperm morphology of two species of caecilians, Ichthyophis tricolor and Uraeotyphlus cf. narayani, from the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, were studied using light and transmission electron microscopy. Spermateleosis is described in early, mid-, and late phases. During the early phase, the spermatid nucleus does not elongate, but the acrosome vesicle is Golgi-derived and its material is produced as a homogeneous substance rather than as discrete granules. In development of the acrosome, the centrioles shift in position to the lower half of the cell. The acrosomal vesicles take the full shape of the acrosome with the establishment of the perforatorium in midphase. An endonuclear canal develops and accommodates the perforatorium. The incipient flagellum is laid down when the proximal centriole attaches to the posterior side of the nucleus and the distal centriole connects to the proximal centriole, which forms the basal granule of the acrosome. The axial fiber also appears during midphase. The mitochondria shift in position to the posterior pole of the cell to commence establishment of the midphase. Late phase is characterized by nuclear condensation and elongation. Consequently, the final organization of the sperm is established with the head containing the nucleus and the acrosome. The undulating membrane separates the axoneme and axial fiber. Most of the cytoplasm is lost as residual bodies. J. Morphol. 262:484499, 2004. 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: All social insects are characterized by a reproductive division of labor. Within a colony only a few individuals reproduce (queens and in termites, also a king) while the large majority (workers and soldiers) forgo reproduction, at least temporarily. The evolution of such reproductive altruism can ultimately be explained by inclusive fitness theory. Here, I will review the proximate genetic mechanisms underlying this altruism in termites. As social cockroaches they evolved eusociality independently from the social Hymenoptera, which makes them interesting test cases to look for common underlying mechanisms of eusociality and lineage specific idiosyncrasies. First, I will provide a summary of the genes and their function that have been identified to underlie reproductive division of labor—so called “queen genes,”—in the drywood termite Cryptotermes secundus, an emerging model to study termite social evolution. Second, I outline how widespread these queen genes are across the termite phylogeny, using also evidence from recent genome analyses. I will provide hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of these queen genes, aiming to link proximate mechanisms with ultimate functions. Finally, I will draw comparisons to social Hymenoptera to indicate potential common underpinnings that warrant further testing.},

abstract = {Several species of Pseudacteon phorid flies, including Pseudacteon cultellatus, P. curvatus, P. obtusus, and P. tricuspis, have been introduced in the southern United States for biological control of imported fire ants, Solenopsis spp. Previous studies showed that Pseudacteon flies use the alarm pheromone and venom alkaloids of fire ants to locate host ant workers. A recent study by our group demonstrated attraction of one of the species, P. tricuspis, to certain alkylpyrazine analogs of fire ant alarm pheromone. If effective, alkylpyrazine analogs of fire ant alarm pheromone may provide cost-efficient alternatives as phorid fly attractants. To test the hypothesis that other phorid fly species are attracted to alkylpyrazine analogs of fire ant alarm pheromone, we compared electroantennogram (EAG) and behavioral responses of four Pseudacteon species, P. cultellatus, P. curvatus, P. obtusus, and P. tricuspis, to the commercially available alarm pheromone isomer (2-ethyl-3,6(or 5)-dimethyl pyrazine) and six structurally related alkylpyrazine analogs at physiologically relevant doses (ranging from picogram to 10 µg). The alarm pheromone isomer and two analogs, 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine and 2 ethyl-3,5 + 6 methyl pyrazine, elicited the strongest EAG activity in all four species at all tested doses. Results from four-choice olfactometer bioassays testing the above three EAG-active compounds showed that all four species were strongly attracted to the alarm pheromone isomer at doses ranging from 0.001 to 1 µg. The flies also showed significant attraction to the two analogs (2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine and 2 ethyl-3,5 + 6 methyl pyrazine) compared to the solvent control but not as strong as the attraction elicited by the alarm pheromone isomer. These results confirm that multiple species of phorid flies use fire ant alarm pheromone as a host location cue. However, the flies are not strongly attracted to the tested alkylpyrazine analogs of the alarm pheromone.},

abstract = {A century after the publication of “Catalogue of the land mammals of western Europe” (1912), Gerrit Smith Miller's contributions to European mammalogy endure. His work was a landmark treatment of the European fauna and laid the groundwork for subsequent mammalogists. Miller's impressive body of specimen-based research underscores the fundamental role natural history collections have played in building our understanding of the natural world. Their relevance to basic discovery endures, as collections have evolved since Miller's time to include new materials (e.g., tissues, cell suspensions, linked host/parasites), and as new tools (e.g., genomic sequencing, stable isotopes, niche envelopes) for extracting information have developed exponentially. While still utilized for systematic and taxonomic questions, museums and associated web-based databases (GBIF, GenBank, GoogleEarth) are now critical to our ability to rigorously address questions related to environmental change (e.g., climate change, habitat conversion, emerging pathogens, pollutants and toxicants, biodiversity loss, introduction of exotics). Specimens are the primary resource that objectively documents diversity and vouchers historic conditions. By representing a particular site and time, georeferenced specimens establish critical baseline conditions against which temporal change can be investigated. As in Miller's day, museums remain centers for research and training as future generations of scientists are introduced to biodiversity studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although numerous prestigious medical organizations have called for its abolishment, participation in the sport of boxing has reached an all-time high among both men and women, and its elimination is unlikely in the near future. Physicians should strive to increase boxing safety by improving the rules of competition, which have evolved minimally over the past two centuries. Currently, subjective criteria are used to determine whether or not a contest should be halted. Developing a standardized, objective method of determining when a contest should be halted would be a significant paradigm shift and could increase the safety of the sport's participants. This study analyzed the number and types of punches landed in a typical professional match, in bouts considered to be competitive and in those that ended in fatalities, to determine whether or not this would be a practical method of differentiating between these groups. METHODS: Three groups of professional boxing matches were defined at the beginning of the study: 1) a "fatal" group, consisting of bouts that resulted in the death of a participant; 2) a "classic" group that represented competitive matches; and 3) a "control" group of 4000 professional boxing matches representing the average bout. A computer program known as Punchstat (Compubox, Inc., Manorville, NY) was used in the objective analysis of these matches via videotape playback. RESULTS: Several statistically significant differences were discovered between matches that resulted in fatalities and the control group. These include the number of punches landed per round, the number of power punches landed per round, and the number of power punches thrown per round by losing boxers. However, when the fatal bouts were compared with the most competitive bouts, these differences were no longer evident. CONCLUSION: Based on the data analyzed between the control and fatal-bout groups, a computerized method of counting landed blows at ringside could provide sufficient data to stop matches that might result in fatalities. However, such a process would become less effective as matches become more competitive, and implementing such a change would significantly decrease the competitive nature of the sport. Therefore, other methods of quantifying acceleration-deceleration brain injuries are necessary to improve the safety of boxing.},

abstract = {This paper reviews top-down regulation analysis, a part of metabolic control analysis, and shows how it can be used to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in complex systems such as energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues. A steady state is maintained by the variables in a system; regulation is the way the steady state is changed by external effectors. We can exploit the properties of the steady state to measure the kinetic responses (elasticities) of reactions to the concentrations of intermediates and effectors. We can reduce the complexity of the system under investigation by grouping reactions into large blocks connected by a small number of explicit intermediates-this is the top-down approach to control analysis. Simple titrations then yield all the values of elasticities and control coefficients within the system. We can use these values to quantify the relative strengths of different internal pathways that act to keep an intermediate or a rate constant in the steady state. We can also use them to quantify the relative strengths of different primary actions of an external effector and the different internal pathways that transmit its effects through the system, to describe regulation and homeostasis. This top-down regulation analysis has been used to analyse steady states of energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues, and to analyse regulation of energy metabolism by cadmium, an external effector, in mitochondria. The combination of relatively simple experiments and new theoretical structures for presenting and interpreting the results means that top-down regulation analysis provides a novel and effective way to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in intricate metabolic systems.},

abstract = {Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

abstract = {1. Intensive agricultural practices drive biodiversity loss with potentially drastic consequences for ecosystem services. To advance conservation and production goals, agricultural practices should be compatible with biodiversity. Traditional or less intensive systems (i.e. with fewer agrochemicals, less mechanisation, more crop species) such as shaded coffee and cacao agroforests are highlighted for their ability to provide a refuge for biodiversity and may also enhance certain ecosystem functions (i.e. pr{\'{e}}dation). 2. Ants are an important predator group in tropical agroforestry systems. Generally, ant biodiversity declines with coffee and cacao intensification yet the literature lacks a summary of the known mechanisms for ant declines and how this diversity loss may affect the role of ants as predators. 3. Here, how shaded coffee and cacao agroforestry systems protect biodiversity and may preserve related ecosystem functions is discussed in the context of ants as predators. Specifically, the relationships between biodiversity and pr{\'{e}}dation, links between agriculture and conservation, patterns and mechanisms for ant diversity loss with agricultural intensification, importance of ants as control agents of pests and fungal diseases, and whether ant diversity may influence the functional role of ants as predators are addressed. Furthermore, because of the importance of homopteran-tending by ants in the ecological and agricultural literature, as well as to the success of ants as predators, the costs and benefits of promoting ants in agroforests are discussed. 4. Especially where the diversity of ants and other predators is high, as in traditional agroforestry systems, both agroecosystem function and conservation goals will be advanced by biodiversity protection.},

With 55 000 entries in the Protein Data Bank and about 500 new structures added each week, automated processing, comparison, and classification are necessary. A variety of methods use different representations, scoring functions, and optimization algorithms, and they generate contradictory results even for moderately distant structures. Sequence mutations, insertions, and deletions are accommodated by plastic deformations of the common core, retaining the precise geometry of the active site, and peripheral regions may refold completely. Therefore structure comparison methods that allow for flexibility and plasticity generate the most biologically meaningful alignments. Active research directions include both the search for fold invariant features and the modeling of structural transitions in evolution.

As usually described, this theory posits that mitochondria are the direct descendants of a bacterial endosymbiont that became established at an early stage in a nucleus-containing (but amitochondriate) host cell. Gene sequence data strongly support a monophyletic origin of the mitochondrion from a eubacterial ancestor shared with a subgroup of the alpha-Proteobacteria. However, recent studies of unicellular eukaryotes (protists), some of them little known, have provided insights that challenge the traditional serial endosymbiosis-based view of how the eukaryotic cell and its mitochondrion came to be. These data indicate that the mitochondrion arose in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this organelle originated at essentially the same time as the nuclear component of the eukaryotic cell rather than in a separate, subsequent event.},

abstract = {The evolutionary history of invasive species within their native range may involve key processes that allow them to colonize new habitats. Therefore, phylogeographic studies of invasive species within their native ranges are useful to understand invasion biology in an evolutionary context. Here we integrated classical and Bayesian phylogeographic methods using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers with a paleodistribution modeling approach, to infer the phylogeographic history of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata across its native distribution in South America. We discuss our results in the context of the recent establishment of this mostly tropical species in the Mediterranean region. Our Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggests that the common ancestor of the two main clades of W. auropunctata occurred in central Brazil during the Pliocene. Clade A would have differentiated northward and clade B southward, followed by a secondary contact beginning about 380,000 years ago in central South America. There were differences in the most suitable habitats among clades when considering three distinct climatic periods, suggesting that genetic differentiation was accompanied by changes in niche requirements, clade A being a tropical lineage and clade B a subtropical and temperate lineage. Only clade B reached more southern latitudes, with a colder climate than that of northern South America. This is concordant with the adaptation of this originally tropical ant species to temperate climates prior to its successful establishment in the Mediterranean region. This study highlights the usefulness of exploring the evolutionary history of invasive species within their native ranges to better understand biological invasions.

The transect consisted of a series of three-tree plots, each plot contained a peanut butter coated stick (the most common detection method used for W. auropunctata in Hawaii), a one-way trap treated with 2-MeBu-diMePy, and a piece of double-sided tape treated with 2-MeBu-diMePy. While there were no differences in the number of W. auropunctata counted with each detection method, and no differences in detection reliability (detecting the known presence of W. auropunctata in a plot), the pheromone-incorporating methods showed greater species specificity, retaining W. auropunctata almost exclusively. These results demonstrate the potential of pheromone-detection methods to selectively capture target ant species even when other ants are present and abundant. Combined data from all three detection methods and a previous visual survey along the transect showed a marked difference in the frequency of cohabitation among ant species. Of the 10 ant species collected, W. auropunctata was found as the sole ant species on a given tree at a significantly higher frequency than all other ant species except Pheidole fervens. 94{\%} percent of the trees with W. auropunctata had only W. auropunctata, supporting previous observations that this species tends to displace other ant species. In addition, W. auropunctata microhabitat preferences were investigated using one-way traps containing 2-MeBu-diMePy, which were placed in three arboreal and three non-arboreal locations. While the number of ants captured did not differ by trap placement, when grouped, captures were significantly higher in arboreal than non-arboreal microhabitats.},

abstract = {We announce the release of an advanced version of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software, which currently contains facilities for building sequence alignments, inferring phylogenetic histories, and conducting molecular evolutionary analysis. In version 6.0, MEGA now enables the inference of timetrees, as it implements the RelTime method for estimating divergence times for all branching points in a phylogeny. A new Timetree Wizard in MEGA6 facilitates this timetree inference by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) to specify the phylogeny and calibration constraints step-by-step. This version also contains enhanced algorithms to search for the optimal trees under evolutionary criteria and implements a more advanced memory management that can double the size of sequence data sets to which MEGA can be applied. Both GUI and command-line versions of MEGA6 can be downloaded from www.megasoftware.net free of charge.},

abstract = {The classification of the ant subfamily Formicinae is revised to reflect findings from a recent molecular phylogenetic study and complementary morphological investigations. The existing classification is maintained as far as possible, but some tribes and genera are redefined to ensure monophyly. Eleven tribes are recognized, all of which are strongly supported as monophyletic groups: Camponotini, Formicini, Gesomyrmecini, Gigantiopini, Lasiini (= Prenolepidii syn. n.), Melo- phorini (= Myrmecorhynchini syn. n.; = Notostigmatini syn. n.), Myrmelachistini stat. rev. (= Brachymyrmicini syn. n.), Myrmoteratini, Oecophyllini, Plagiolepidini, and Santschiellini stat. rev. Most of the tribes remain similar in content, but the generic composition of Lasiini, Melophorini, and Plagiolepidini is changed substantially. Species that have been placed in the genus Camponotus belong to three separate lineages. To ensure monophyly of this large, cosmopolitan genus we institute the following changes: Colobopsis and Dinomyrmex, both former subgenera of Camponotus, are elevated to genus level (stat. rev.), and two former genera, Forelophilus and Phasmomyrmex, are demoted to subgenus status (stat. n. and stat. rev., respectively) under Camponotus; two erstwhile subgenera of Phasmomyrmex, Myrmorhachis and Myr- macantha, become junior synonyms (syn. n.) of Camponotus (Phasmomyrmex); and the Camponotus subgenus Myrmog- onia becomes a junior synonym (syn. n.) of Colobopsis. Dinomyrmex, represented by a single species from southeast Asia, D. gigas, is quite distinctive, but Camponotus and Colobopsis exhibit more subtle differences, despite being well separated phylogenetically. We identify morphological features of the worker caste that are broadly useful for distinguishing these two genera. Colobopsis species on the islands of New Caledonia and Fiji—regions with few native Camponotus species— tend to exceed these diagnostic bounds, but in this case regionally applicable character differences can be used to distin- guish the two clades. Despite confusing similarities in the worker caste Colobopsis and Camponotus retain diagnostic dif- ferences in their larvae and pupae. Key},

abstract = {Abstract.  The ant subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae comprises three genera of hyperoptic, arboreal ants, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions: Pseudomyrmex (∼200 species, New World), Myrcidris (two species, South America) and Tetraponera (∼100 species, Palaeotropics). The phylogenetic relationships among these ants were investigated using DNA sequence data (∼5.2 kb from 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, wingless, abdominal-A, and long-wavelength rhodopsin genes) and 144 morphological characters, both separately and in combination. Data were gathered from a representative set of forty-nine pseudomyrmecine species, plus eighteen species from various outgroups. There was substantial agreement among the results obtained from different datasets, and from different methods of phylogenetic inference (parsimony, Bayesian inference). The monophyly of the following groups is strongly supported (100{\%} bootstrap support and 1.00 posterior probability in the molecular dataset): Pseudomyrmecinae, Pseudomyrmex, and Pseudomyrmex + Myrcidris. The status of the genus Tetraponera is less clear: the DNA sequence data indicate that the genus is paraphyletic, but morphological features and a unique insertion in the 28S gene support the monophyly of this taxon. Seven of nine Pseudomyrmex species groups, established previously on the basis of morphology alone, are strongly upheld, but monophyly is rejected for the P. pallens group and the P. viduus group. In the latter case, molecular evidence indicates the existence of two independent clades, associated with the ant-plants Triplaris and Tachigali, respectively, whose convergent morphological features had caused them to be placed erroneously in the same species group. The present results confirm an earlier assertion that obligate associations with domatia-bearing plants have arisen at least twelve times in the subfamily. Molecular and morphological data support the hypothesis of a sister-group relationship between Pseudomyrmecinae and Myrmeciinae (84{\%} parsimony bootstrap, combined dataset), which implies a Cretaceous origin of the stem-group pseudomyrmecines in the southern hemisphere. Pseudomyrmecines appear to have arisen in the Palaeotropics and later dispersed from Africa to South America, where they experienced a pronounced burst of diversification.},

abstract = {The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, has been increasing in importance as an exotic pest. Here we review published and unpub-lished information on its distribution, ecology, impact, and control. Wasmannia auropunctata occurs throughout most of the warmer parts of the New World, from subtropical Argentina to subtropical Mexico and through much of the Caribbean, though it is not clear whether this species in native to this entire region. During the past century, exotic populations of W. auropunctata have become established in numerous other places, including the Galapagos Islands, West Africa (Gabon, Cameroon, and possibly the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo), Melanesia (New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and possibly Tuvalu), Polynesia (Wallis and Futuna and Hawaii), the mainland US (Florida and possibly California), and on subtropical Atlantic islands (the Bahamas and Bermuda). The latitudi-nal range of known outdoors populations of W. auropunctata is from 32{\textordmasculine}40'S in Argentina to 32{\textordmasculine}20'N in Bermuda. Wasmannia auropunctata is also a greenhouse pest in more temperate regions, such as England and Canada. In many areas, W. auropunctata can be a significant agricultural pest, not only stinging agricultural workers, but also enhancing populations of Homoptera. Homoptera cause damage both through sapping plants of nutrients and by increasing the occurrence of diseases, including viral and fungal infections. In addition, W. auropunctata has negative impacts on many animals, both inverte-brates and vertebrates, though most reports on such impact have been anecdotal. The impacts of W. auropunctata populations seem to be most severe on tropical islands where it is not native, such as the Galapagos, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. Reports of widespread blindness in both domestic and native mammals caused by W. auropunctata stings deserve serious attention. Chemical control of W. auropunctata may be possible for small exotic populations spread over a few dozen hectares or less. For large exotic infestations, the only hope for long-term control appears to be classical biocontrol.},

abstract = {As sites of cellular respiration and energy production, mitochondria play a central role in cell metabolism. Cell differentiation is associated with an increase in mitochondrial content and activity and with a metabolic shift toward increased oxidative phosphorylation activity. The opposite occurs during reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Studies have provided evidence of mitochondrial and metabolic changes during the differentiation of both embryonic and somatic (or adult) stem cells (SSCs), such as hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and tissue-specific progenitor cells. We thus propose to consider those mitochondrial and metabolic changes as hallmarks of differentiation processes. We review how mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and function are directly involved in embryonic and SSC differentiation and how metabolic and sensing pathways connect mitochondria and metabolism with cell fate and pluripotency. Understanding the basis of the crosstalk between mitochondria and cell fate is of critical importance, given the promising application of stem cells in regenerative medicine. In addition to the development of novel strategies to improve the in vitro lineage-directed differentiation of stem cells, understanding the molecular basis of this interplay could lead to the identification of novel targets to improve the treatment of degenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Housed worldwide, mostly in museums and herbaria, is a vast collection of biological specimens developed over centuries. These biological collections, and associated taxonomic and systematic research, have received considerable long-term public support. The work remaining in systematics has been expanding as the estimated total number of species of organisms on Earth has risen over recent decades, as have estimated numbers of undescribed species. Despite this increasing task, support for taxonomic and systematic research, and biological collections upon which such research is based, has declined over the last 30-40 years, while other areas of biological research have grown considerably, especially those that focus on environmental issues. Reflecting increases in research that deals with ecological questions (e.g. what determines species distribution and abundance) or environmental issues (e.g. toxic pollution), the level of research attempting to use biological collections in museums or herbaria in an ecological/environmental context has risen dramatically during about the last 20 years. The perceived relevance of biological collections, and hence the support they receive, should be enhanced if this trend continues and they are used prominently regarding such environmental issues as anthropogenic loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem function, global climate change, and decay of the epidemiological environment. It is unclear, however, how best to use biological collections in the context of such ecological/environmental issues or how best to manage collections to facilitate such use. We demonstrate considerable and increasingly realized potential for research based on biological collections to contribute to ecological/environmental understanding. However, because biological collections were not originally intended for use regarding such issues and have inherent biases and limitations, they are proving more useful in some contexts than in others. Biological collections have, for example, been particularly useful as sources of information regarding variation in attributes of individuals (e.g. morphology, chemical composition) in relation to environmental variables, and provided important information in relation to species' distributions, but less useful in the contexts of habitat associations and population sizes. Changes to policies, strategies and procedures associated with biological collections could mitigate these biases and limitations, and hence make such collections more useful in the context of ecological/environmental issues. Haphazard and opportunistic collecting could be replaced with strategies for adding to existing collections that prioritize projects that use biological collections and include, besides taxonomy and systematics, a focus on significant environmental/ecological issues. Other potential changes include increased recording of the nature and extent of collecting effort and information associated with each specimen such as nearby habitat and other individuals observed but not collected. Such changes have begun to occur within some institutions. Institutions that house biological collections should, we think, pursue a mission of 'understanding the life of the planet to inform its stewardship' (Krishtalka {\&} Humphrey, 2000), as such a mission would facilitate increased use of biological collections in an ecological/environmental context and hence lead to increased appreciation, encouragement and support from the public for these collections, their associated research, and the institutions that house them.},

Despite all efforts of manual curation it is still plagued by misassignments of reading directions, erroneous gene names, and missing as well as false positive annotations in particular for the RNA genes. Taken together, this causes substantial problems for fully automatic pipelines that aim to use these data comprehensively for studies of animal phylogenetics and the molecular evolution of mitogenomes. The MITOS pipeline is designed to compute a consistent de novo annotation of the mitogenomic sequences. We show that the results of MITOS match RefSeq and MitoZoa in terms of annotation coverage and quality.

abstract = {Many remnants of tropical forests are surrounded by deforested areas dominated by successional vegetation. Although secondary dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents and ants may influence seed predation and seedling recruitment, very little is known about its importance in degraded forest ecosystems. We studied the effects of secondary dispersal on seed predation, germination and seedling recruitment of the primarily bird-dispersed tree Clusia trochiformis in a tropical montane forest in Bolivia. We carried out exclosure experiments that allowed or excluded access to seeds by vertebrates in three habitat types (forest interior, degraded habitat close to and degraded habitat far from the forest margin) in a spatial block design at six sites. We offered a total of 1440 seeds (both with and without an aril) and marked half of them with a thread to follow their fate after 48 h and after 1 month. We found that secondary dispersal by ants was highest in the forest interior but was also frequent in degraded habitats close to and far from the forest edge. Secondary dispersal significantly increased seedling recruitment, particularly in the degraded habitats, probably because seeds were often dispersed to sites beneath the leaf litter. Recruitment success increased significantly with dispersal distance. High recruitment of secondarily dispersed seeds in the degraded habitat was due to the combined effect of reduced predation and increased germination of seeds that had been moved by ants. Synthesis. In the absence of secondary dispersal, seed germination and seedling recruitment were very low in degraded habitats. Seed dispersal by ants substantially increased natural regeneration in the deforested habitats. Our experiments thus demonstrate that the effects of biotic interactions on plant demography can vary across habitat boundaries at small spatial scales and that secondary dispersal is a crucial and overlooked process that can aid the regeneration of deforested habitats in the tropics.

The earliest records of P. stigma come primarily from the Neotropics; before 1900, there were published Neotropical records from Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Panama, St Vincent, and Cuba, but only one published record from the Old World (Aru Island, Indonesia). Although P. stigma has relatives in both the Neotropics and Australia, its closest known relative is from Central America. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that P. stigma originated in tropical South and Central America. Genetic analyses are needed to determine whether the native range of P. stigma also includes the West Indies and Florida},

abstract = {Computer simulations provide a flexible method for assessing the power and robustness of phylogenetic inference methods. Unfortunately, simulated data are often obviously atypical of data encountered in studies of molecular evolution. Unrealistic simulations can lead to conclusions that are irrelevant to real-data analyses or can provide a biased view of which methods perform well. Here, we present a software tool designed to generate data under a complex codon model that allows each residue in the protein sequence to have a different set of equilibrium amino acid frequencies. The software can obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of the Halpern and Bruno model from empirical data and a fixed tree; given an arbitrary tree and a fixed set of parameters, the software can then simulate artificial datasets.We present the results of a simulation experiment using randomly generated tree shapes and substitution parameters estimated from 1610 mammalian cytochrome b sequences.We tested tree inference at the amino acid, nucleotide and codon levels and under parsimony, maximum-likelihood, Bayesian and distance criteria (for a total of more than 650 analyses on each dataset). Based on these simulations, nucleotide-level analyses seem to be more accurate than amino acid and codon analyses. The performance of distance-based phylogenetic methods appears to be quite sensitive to the choice of model and the form of rate heterogeneity used. Further studies are needed to assess the generality of these conclusions. For example, fitting parameters of the Halpern Bruno model to sequences from other genes will reveal the extent to which our conclusions were influenced by the choice of cytochrome b. Incorporating codon bias and more sources heterogeneity into the simulator will be crucial to determining whether the current results are caused by a bias in the current simulation study in favour of nucleotide analyses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A so called "taxonomic impediment" has been recognized as a major obstacle to biodiversity research for the past two decades. Numerous remedies were then proposed. However, neither significant progress in terms of formal species descriptions, nor a minimum standard for descriptions have been achieved so far. Here, we analyze the problems of traditional taxonomy which often produces keys and descriptions of limited practical value. We suggest that phylogenetics and phenetics had a subtle and so far unnoticed effect on taxonomy leading to inflated species descriptions.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nDISCUSSION: The term "turbo-taxonomy" was recently coined for an approach combining cox1 sequences, concise morphological descriptions by an expert taxonomist, and high-resolution digital imaging to streamline the formal description of larger numbers of new species. We propose a further development of this approach which, together with open access web-publication and automated pushing of content from journal into a wiki, may create the most efficient and sustainable way to conduct taxonomy in the future. On demand, highly concise descriptions can be gradually updated or modified in the fully versioned wiki-framework we use. This means that the visibility of additional data is not compromised, while the original species description -the first version- remains preserved in the wiki, and of course in the journal version. A DNA sequence database with an identification engine replaces an identification key, helps to avoid synonyms and has the potential to detect grossly incorrect generic placements. We demonstrate the functionality of a species-description pipeline by naming 101 new species of hyperdiverse New Guinea Trigonopterus weevils in the open-access journal ZooKeys.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nSUMMARY: Fast track taxonomy will not only increase speed, but also sustainability of global species inventories. It will be of great practical value to all the other disciplines that depend on a usable taxonomy and will change our perception of global biodiversity. While this approach is certainly not suitable for all taxa alike, it is the tool that will help to tackle many hyperdiverse groups and pave the road for more sustainable comparative studies, e.g. in community ecology, phylogeography and large scale biogeographic studies.},

abstract = {The classification of the ant subfamily Formicinae is revised to reflect findings from a recent molecular phylogenetic study and complementary morphological investigations. The existing classification is maintained as far as possible, but some tribes and genera are redefined to ensure monophyly. Eleven tribes are recognized, all of which are strongly supported as monophyletic groups: Camponotini, Formicini, Gesomyrmecini, Gigantiopini, Lasiini (= Prenolepidii syn. n.), Melo- phorini (= Myrmecorhynchini syn. n.; = Notostigmatini syn. n.), Myrmelachistini stat. rev. (= Brachymyrmicini syn. n.), Myrmoteratini, Oecophyllini, Plagiolepidini, and Santschiellini stat. rev. Most of the tribes remain similar in content, but the generic composition of Lasiini, Melophorini, and Plagiolepidini is changed substantially. Species that have been placed in the genus Camponotus belong to three separate lineages. To ensure monophyly of this large, cosmopolitan genus we institute the following changes: Colobopsis and Dinomyrmex, both former subgenera of Camponotus, are elevated to genus level (stat. rev.), and two former genera, Forelophilus and Phasmomyrmex, are demoted to subgenus status (stat. n. and stat. rev., respectively) under Camponotus; two erstwhile subgenera of Phasmomyrmex, Myrmorhachis and Myr- macantha, become junior synonyms (syn. n.) of Camponotus (Phasmomyrmex); and the Camponotus subgenus Myrmog- onia becomes a junior synonym (syn. n.) of Colobopsis. Dinomyrmex, represented by a single species from southeast Asia, D. gigas, is quite distinctive, but Camponotus and Colobopsis exhibit more subtle differences, despite being well separated phylogenetically. We identify morphological features of the worker caste that are broadly useful for distinguishing these two genera. Colobopsis species on the islands of New Caledonia and Fiji—regions with few native Camponotus species— tend to exceed these diagnostic bounds, but in this case regionally applicable character differences can be used to distin- guish the two clades. Despite confusing similarities in the worker caste Colobopsis and Camponotus retain diagnostic dif- ferences in their larvae and pupae. Key},

abstract = {Eusocial behavior has arisen in few animal groups, most notably in the aculeate Hymenoptera, a clade comprising ants, bees, and stinging wasps [1-4]. Phylogeny is crucial to understanding the evolution of the salient features of these insects, including eusociality [5]. Yet the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of aculeate Hymenoptera remain contentious [6-12]. We address this problem here by generating and analyzing genomic data for a representative series of taxa. We obtain a single well-resolved and strongly supported tree, robust to multiple methods of phylogenetic inference. Apoidea (spheciform wasps and bees) and ants are sister groups, a novel finding that contradicts earlier views that ants are closer to ectoparasitoid wasps. Vespid wasps (paper wasps, yellow jackets, and relatives) are sister to all other aculeates except chrysidoids. Thus, all eusocial species of Hymenoptera are contained within two major groups, characterized by transport of larval provisions and nest construction, likely prerequisites for the evolution of eusociality. These two lineages are interpolated among three other clades of wasps whose species are predominantly ectoparasitoids on concealed hosts, the inferred ancestral condition for aculeates [2]. This phylogeny provides a new framework for exploring the evolution of nesting, feeding, and social behavior within the stinging Hymenoptera. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Many software packages have been developed for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treatment groups based on RNA-Seq data. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to approach an optimal study design and choice of suitable software for the analysis. In this comparative study we evaluate the performance of three of the most frequently used software tools: Cufflinks-Cuffdiff2, DESeq and edgeR. A number of important parameters of RNA-Seq technology were taken into consideration, including the number of replicates, sequencing depth, and balanced vs. unbalanced sequencing depth within and between groups. We benchmarked results relative to sets of DEGs identified through either quantitative RT-PCR or microarray. We observed that edgeR performs slightly better than DESeq and Cuffdiff2 in terms of the ability to uncover true positives. Overall, DESeq or taking the intersection of DEGs from two or more tools is recommended if the number of false positives is a major concern in the study. In other circumstances, edgeR is slightly preferable for differential expression analysis at the expense of potentially introducing more false positives.},

abstract = {This study investigates the evolutionary history of a hyperdiverse clade, the ant subfamily Myrmicinae (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), based on analyses of a data matrix comprising 251 species and 11 nuclear gene fragments. Under both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of inference, we recover a robust phylogeny that reveals six major clades of Myrmicinae, here treated as newly defined tribes and occurring as a pectinate series: Myrmicini, Pogonomyrmecini trib.n., Stenammini, Solenopsidini, Attini and Crematogastrini. Because we condense the former 25 myrmicine tribes into a new six-tribe scheme, membership in some tribes is now notably different, especially regarding Attini. We demonstrate that the monotypic genus Ankylomyrma is neither in the Myrmicinae nor even a member of the more inclusive formicoid clade—rather it is a poneroid ant, sister to the genus Tatuidris (Agroecomyrmecinae). Several species-rich myrmicine genera are shown to be nonmonophyletic, including Pogonomyrmex, Aphaenogaster, Messor, Monomorium, Pheidole, Temnothorax and Tetramorium. We propose a number of generic synonymies to partially alleviate these problems (senior synonym listed first): Pheidole = Anisopheidole syn.n. = Machomyrma syn.n.; Temnothorax = Chalepoxenus syn.n. = Myrmoxenus syn.n. = Protomognathus syn.n.; Tetramorium = Rhoptromyrmex syn.n. = Anergates syn.n. = Teleutomyrmex syn.n. The genus Veromessor stat.r. is resurrected for the New World species previously placed in Messor; Syllophopsis stat.r. is resurrected from synonymy under Monomorium to contain the species in the hildebrandti group; Trichomyrmex stat.r. is resurrected from synonymy under Monomorium to contain the species in the scabriceps- and destructor-groups; and the monotypic genus Epelysidris stat.r. is reinstated for Monomorium brocha. Bayesian divergence dating indicates that the crown group Myrmicinae originated about 98.6 Ma (95{\%} highest probability density 87.9–109.6 Ma) but the six major clades are considerably younger, with age estimates ranging from 52.3 to 71.1 Ma. Although these and other suprageneric taxa arose mostly in the middle Eocene or earlier, a number of prominent, species-rich genera, such as Pheidole, Cephalotes, Strumigenys, Crematogaster and Tetramorium, have estimated crown group origins in the late Eocene or Oligocene. Most myrmicine species diversity resides in the two sister clades, Attini and Crematogastrini, which are estimated to have originated and diversified extensively in the Neotropics and Paleotropics, respectively. The newly circumscribed Myrmicini is Holarctic in distribution, and ancestral range estimation suggests a Nearctic origin. The Pogonomyrmecini and Solenopsidini are reconstructed as being Neotropical in origin, but they have subsequently colonized the Nearctic region (Pogonomyrmecini) and many parts of the Old World as well as the Nearctic region (Solenopsidini), respectively. The Stenammini have flourished primarily in the northern hemisphere, and are most likely of Nearctic origin, but selected lineages have dispersed to the northern Neotropics and the Paleotropics. Thus the evolutionary history of the Myrmicinae has played out on a global stage over the last 100 Ma, with no single region being the principal generator of species diversity.

abstract = {We present an in silico approach for the reconstruction of complete mitochondrial genomes of non-model organisms directly from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data-mitochondrial baiting and iterative mapping (MITObim). The method is straightforward even if only (i) distantly related mitochondrial genomes or (ii) mitochondrial barcode sequences are available as starting-reference sequences or seeds, respectively. We demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in case studies using real NGS data sets of the two monogenean ectoparasites species Gyrodactylus thymalli and Gyrodactylus derjavinoides including their respective teleost hosts European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). MITObim appeared superior to existing tools in terms of accuracy, runtime and memory requirements and fully automatically recovered mitochondrial genomes exceeding 99.5{\%} accuracy from total genomic DNA derived NGS data sets in {\textless}24 h using a standard desktop computer. The approach overcomes the limitations of traditional strategies for obtaining mitochondrial genomes for species with little or no mitochondrial sequence information at hand and represents a fast and highly efficient in silico alternative to laborious conventional strategies relying on initial long-range PCR. We furthermore demonstrate the applicability of MITObim for metagenomic/pooled data sets using simulated data. MITObim is an easy to use tool even for biologists with modest bioinformatics experience. The software is made available as open source pipeline under the MIT license at https://github.com/chrishah/MITObim.},

abstract = {High-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have revolutionized the ability of genome-wide association studies to detect genomic regions harboring sequence variants that affect complex traits. Extensive numbers of validated SNPs with known allele frequencies are essential to construct genotyping assays with broad utility. We describe an economical, efficient, single-step method for SNP discovery, validation and characterization that uses deep sequencing of reduced representation libraries (RRLs) from specified target populations. Using nearly 50 million sequences generated on an Illumina Genome Analyzer from DNA of 66 cattle representing three populations, we identified 62,042 putative SNPs and predicted their allele frequencies. Genotype data for these 66 individuals validated 92{\%} of 23,357 selected genome-wide SNPs, with a genotypic and sequence allele frequency correlation of r = 0.67. This approach for simultaneous de novo discovery of high-quality SNPs and population characterization of allele frequencies may be applied to any species with at least a partially sequenced genome.},

abstract = {Mountain ranges, deserts, ice fields and oceans generally act as barriers to the movement of land-dependent animals, often profoundly shaping migration routes. We used satellite telemetry to track the southward flights of bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica baueri), shorebirds whose breeding and non-breeding areas are separated by the vast central Pacific Ocean. Seven females with surgically implanted transmitters flew non-stop 8,117-11,680 km (10153+/-1043 s.d.) directly across the Pacific Ocean; two males with external transmitters flew non-stop along the same corridor for 7,008-7,390 km. Flight duration ranged from 6.0 to 9.4 days (7.8+/-1.3 s.d.) for birds with implants and 5.0 to 6.6 days for birds with externally attached transmitters. These extraordinary non-stop flights establish new extremes for avian flight performance, have profound implications for understanding the physiological capabilities of vertebrates and how birds navigate, and challenge current physiological paradigms on topics such as sleep, dehydration and phenotypic flexibility. Predicted changes in climatic systems may affect survival rates if weather conditions at their departure hub or along the migration corridor should change. We propose that this transoceanic route may function as an ecological corridor rather than a barrier, providing a wind-assisted passage relatively free of pathogens and predators.},

abstract = {The biology of honey bees involves a host of developmental, behavioral, and physiological components that allow thousands of individual bees to form complex social units. Fueled by a wealth of information from new genomic technologies, a new approach, sociogenomics, uses a focus on the genome to integrate the molecular underpinnings and ultimate explanations of social life. This approach has resulted in a massive influx of data from the honey bee genome and transcriptome, a flurry of research activity, and new insights into honey bee biology. Here, we provide an up-to-date review describing how the honey bee has been successfully studied using this approach, highlighting how the integration of genomic information into honey bee research has provided insights into worker division of labor, communication, caste differences and development, evolution, and honey bee health. We also highlight how genomic studies in other eusocial insect species have provided insights into social evolution via comparative analyses. These data have led to several important new insights about how social behavior is organized on a genomic level, including (1) the fact that gene expression is highly dynamic and responsive to the social environment, (2) that large-scale changes in gene expression can contribute to caste and behavioral differences, (3) that transcriptional networks regulating these behaviors can be related to previously established hormonal mechanisms, and (4) that some genes and pathways retain conserved roles in behavior across contexts and social insect taxa.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous study of higher-level arthropod phylogeny, analyses of nucleotide sequences from 62 protein-coding nuclear genes for 80 panarthopod species yielded significantly higher bootstrap support for selected nodes than did amino acids. This study investigates the cause of that discrepancy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hypothesis is tested that failure to distinguish the serine residues encoded by two disjunct clusters of codons (TCN, AGY) in amino acid analyses leads to this discrepancy. In one test, the two clusters of serine codons (Ser1, Ser2) are conceptually translated as separate amino acids. Analysis of the resulting 21-amino-acid data matrix shows striking increases in bootstrap support, in some cases matching that in nucleotide analyses. In a second approach, nucleotide and 20-amino-acid data sets are artificially altered through targeted deletions, modifications, and replacements, revealing the pivotal contributions of distinct Ser1 and Ser2 codons. We confirm that previous methods of coding nonsynonymous nucleotide change are robust and computationally efficient by introducing two new degeneracy coding methods. We demonstrate for degeneracy coding that neither compositional heterogeneity at the level of nucleotides nor codon usage bias between Ser1 and Ser2 clusters of codons (or their separately coded amino acids) is a major source of non-phylogenetic signal. CONCLUSIONS: The incongruity in support between amino-acid and nucleotide analyses of the forementioned arthropod data set is resolved by showing that "standard" 20-amino-acid analyses yield lower node support specifically when serine provides crucial signal. Separate coding of Ser1 and Ser2 residues yields support commensurate with that found by degenerated nucleotides, without introducing phylogenetic artifacts. While exclusion of all serine data leads to reduced support for serine-sensitive nodes, these nodes are still recovered in the ML topology, indicating that the enhanced signal from Ser1 and Ser2 is not qualitatively different from that of the other amino acids.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial (mt) genome is, to date, the most extensively studied genomic system in insects, outnumbering nuclear genomes tenfold and representing all orders versus very few. Phylogenomic analysis methods have been tested extensively, identifying compositional bias and rate variation, both within and between lineages, as the principal issues confronting accurate analyses. Major studies at both inter- and intraordinal levels have contributed to our understanding of phylogenetic relationships within many groups. Genome rearrangements are an additional data type for defining relationships, with rearrangement synapomorphies identified across multiple orders and at many different taxonomic levels. Hymenoptera and Psocodea have greatly elevated rates of rearrangement offering both opportunities and pitfalls for identifying rearrangement synapomorphies in each group. Finally, insects are model systems for studying aberrant mt genomes, including truncated tRNAs and multichromosomal genomes. Greater integration of nuclear and mt genomic studies is necessary to further our understanding of insect genomic evolution.},

abstract = {Essential amino acids (EAA) consist of a group of nine amino acids that animals are unable to synthesize via de novo pathways. Recently, it has been found that most metazoans lack the same set of enzymes responsible for the de novo EAA biosynthesis. Here we investigate the sequence conservation and evolution of all the metazoan remaining genes for EAA pathways. Initially, the set of all 49 enzymes responsible for the EAA de novo biosynthesis in yeast was retrieved. These enzymes were used as BLAST queries to search for similar sequences in a database containing 10 complete metazoan genomes. Eight enzymes typically attributed to EAA pathways were found to be ubiquitous in metazoan genomes, suggesting a conserved functional role. In this study, we address the question of how these genes evolved after losing their pathway partners. To do this, we compared metazoan genes with their fungal and plant orthologs. Using phylogenetic analysis with maximum likelihood, we found that acetolactate synthase (ALS) and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) diverged from the expected Tree of Life (ToL) relationships. High sequence conservation in the paraphyletic group Plant-Fungi was identified for these two genes using a newly developed Python algorithm. Selective pressure analysis of ALS and BHMT protein sequences showed higher non-synonymous mutation ratios in comparisons between metazoans/fungi and metazoans/plants, supporting the hypothesis that these two genes have undergone non-ToL evolution in animals.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluatedfound only 20{\%}-40{\%} of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85{\%} for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85{\%} for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5{\%} for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, bparticularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

The most important results of this study include: (1) the monophyly of Ponerinae; (2) the paraphyly of Ponerini; (3) the extensive non-monophyly of Pachycondyla; (4) a rapid basal radiation in Ponerini; (5) resolution of many deeper relationships within Ponerini; (6) a rapid {\&} rich basal radiation in the Odontomachus group; (7) an origin for Ponerinae in the upper Cretaceous, with a major burst of diversification near the K/T boundary; (8) a history of rich {\&} continual ponerine diversification during the Cenozoic; (9) a history of regionalized radiations {\&} frequent faunal exchange between major biogeographic provinces; {\&} (10) support for multiple origins of gamergates in Ponerinae. Ponerine taxonomic classification is revised to reflect both these phylogenetic results {\&} a re-appraisal of ponerine morphological diversity.

Molecular {\&} morphological justifications for these taxonomic changes are given alongside discussions of phylogenetic relationships.

abstract = {The publication of a complete genome sequence is usually accompanied by annotations of its genes. In contrast to protein coding genes, genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are often poorly or inconsistently annotated. This makes comparative studies based on rRNA genes difficult. We have therefore created computational predictors for the major rRNA species from all kingdoms of life and compiled them into a program called RNAmmer. The program uses hidden Markov models trained on data from the 5S ribosomal RNA database and the European ribosomal RNA database project. A pre-screening step makes the method fast with little loss of sensitivity, enabling the analysis of a complete bacterial genome in less than a minute. Results from running RNAmmer on a large set of genomes indicate that the location of rRNAs can be predicted with a very high level of accuracy. Novel, unannotated rRNAs are also predicted in many genomes. The software as well as the genome analysis results are available at the CBS web server. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author(s).},

These collections are a crucial cornerstone for systematics, natural history, ecology, and many other specialized disciplines, whose research depends on either the specimen or the associated data. Recent studies have provided baseline information pertaining to the monetary costs associated with collecting scientific specimens and curating and caring for those specimens after they have been accessioned into a natural history collection. Here, we provide a synopsis of the primary benefits that natural history collections provide to science and society. Furthermore, given that financial support is crucial for long-term growth and care, we present several ideas that should be considered by curators and users of systematic collections.},

Field experiments were conducted in order to elucidate the relative attractiveness of the enantiomers of the alarm pheromones, 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine. The enantiomers tested were synthesized from commercially available (S)-2-methylbutan-1-ol or kinetically resolved (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol, prepared using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (PCL). Bioassays conducted in a macadamia orchard on the island of Hawaii demonstrated that W. auropunctata were preferentially attracted to the (S)-enantiomers of both alkyl pyrazines over the racemic mixtures in all experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of differential attraction of ants to the enantiomers of chiral pyrazine pheromones despite many examples of these compounds in the literature. In addition, using a chiral column it was determined that (S)-2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and (S)-3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine are the only enantiomers produced by W. auropunctata.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics and altered the scientific publication landscape. Life-science journals abound with genome papers-peer-reviewed descriptions of newly sequenced chromosomes. Although they once filled the pages of Nature and Science, genome papers are now mostly relegated to journals with low-impact factors. Some have forecast the death of the genome paper and argued that they are using up valuable resources and not advancing science. However, the publication rate of genome papers is on the rise. This increase is largely because some journals have created a new category of manuscript called genome reports, which are short, fast-tracked papers describing a chromosome sequence(s), its GenBank accession number and little else. In 2015, for example, more than 2000 genome reports were published, and 2016 is poised to bring even more. Here, I highlight the growing popularity of genome reports and discuss their merits, drawbacks and impact on science and the academic publication infrastructure. Genome reports can be excellent assets for the research community, but they are also being used as quick and easy routes to a publication , and in some instances they are not peer reviewed. One of the best arguments for genome reports is that they are a citable, user-generated genomic resource providing essential methodological and biological information, which may not be present in the sequence database. But they are expensive and time-consuming avenues for achieving such a goal. Birth of the genome paper Nearly four decades ago, Sanger et al. [1] decoded, for the first time, the entire DNA sequence of a genome, that of the bacterio-phage UX174. This historic achievement also marked the inception of a new genre of scientific article: the genome paper. It would take another 4 years before scientists sequenced and published a human chromosome-our mitochondrial genome [2]-and an additional 15 years for the arrival of a nuclear gen-ome paper (yeast) [3]. These and other pioneering genome sequences , such as that of Haemophilus influenzae [4], had a massive and lasting impact on life-science research. The human mitochondrial genome paper [2], for example, has been cited more than 8000 times. By the turn of the millennium, genome papers were fast becoming among the most publicized and cited articles within the scientific literature. The simultaneously published articles describing the human genome [5, 6] topped Thomson Reuters' Science Watch list of 'hot papers' in biology of 2001 [7]. These same articles were also widely covered by scientific and popular news media, which has become a recurring theme for genome papers of all stripes. Just think of all the university press releases , journal editorials and news stories that you have read David Roy Smith is an assistant professor of biology at the University of Western Ontario.

abstract = {Ants (Formicidae) represent a taxonomically diverse group of hymenopterans with over 13,000 extant species, the majority of which inject or spray secretions from a venom gland. The evolutionary success of ants is mostly due to their unique eusociality that has permitted them to develop complex collaborative strategies, partly involving their venom secretions, to defend their nest against predators, microbial pathogens, ant competitors, and to hunt prey. Activities of ant venom include paralytic, cytolytic, haemolytic, allergenic, pro-inflammatory, insecticidal, antimicrobial, and pain-producing pharmacologic activities, while non-toxic functions include roles in chemical communication involving trail and sex pheromones, deterrents, and aggregators. While these diverse activities in ant venoms have until now been largely understudied due to the small venom yield from ants, modern analytical and venomic techniques are beginning to reveal the diversity of toxin structure and function. As such, ant venoms are distinct from other venomous animals, not only rich in linear, dimeric and disulfide-bonded peptides and bioactive proteins, but also other volatile and non-volatile compounds such as alkaloids and hydrocarbons. The present review details the unique structures and pharmacologies of known ant venom proteinaceous and alkaloidal toxins and their potential as a source of novel bioinsecticides and therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Army ants are dominant invertebrate predators in tropical and subtropical terrestrial ecosystems. Their close relatives within the dorylomorph group of ants are also highly specialized predators, although much less is known about their biology. We analyzed molecular data generated from 11 nuclear genes to infer a phylogeny for the major dorylomorph lineages, and incorporated fossil evidence to infer divergence times under a relaxed molecular clock.RESULTS:Because our results indicate that one subfamily and several genera of dorylomorphs are non-monophyletic, we propose to subsume the six previous dorylomorph subfamilies into a single subfamily, Dorylinae. We find the monophyly of Dorylinae to be strongly supported and estimate the crown age of the group at 87 (74-101) million years. Our phylogenetic analyses provide only weak support for army ant monophyly and also call into question a previous hypothesis that army ants underwent a fundamental split into New World and Old World lineages. Outside the army ants, our phylogeny reveals for the first time many old, distinct lineages in the Dorylinae. The genus Cerapachys is shown to be non-monophyletic and comprised of multiple lineages scattered across the Dorylinae tree. We recover, with strong support, novel relationships among these Cerapachys-like clades and other doryline genera, but divergences in the deepest parts of the tree are not well resolved. We find the genus Sphinctomyrmex, characterized by distinctive abdominal constrictions, to consist of two separate lineages with convergent morphologies, one inhabiting the Old World and the other the New World tropics.CONCLUSIONS:While we obtain good resolution in many parts of the Dorylinae phylogeny, relationships deep in the tree remain unresolved, with major lineages joining each other in various ways depending upon the analytical method employed, but always with short internodes. This may be indicative of rapid radiation in the early history of the Dorylinae, but additional molecular data and more complete species sampling are needed for confirmation. Our phylogeny now provides a basic framework for comparative biological analyses, but much additional study on the behavior and morphology of doryline species is needed, especially investigations directed at the non-army ant taxa.},

abstract = {The ants in the subfamily Amblyoponinae are an old, relictual group with an unusual suite of morphological and behavioural features. Adult workers pierce the integument of their larvae to imbibe haemolymph, earning them the vernacular name ‘dracula ants'. We investigate the phylogeny of this group with a data set based on 54 ingroup taxa, 23 outgroups and 11 nuclear gene fragments (7.4 kb). We find that the genus Opamyrma has been misplaced in this subfamily: it is a member of the leptanilline clade and sister to all other extant Leptanillinae. Transfer of Opamyrma to Leptanillinae renders the Amblyoponinae monophyletic. The enigmatic Afrotropical genus Apomyrma is sister to all other amblyoponines, and the latter cleave into two distinct and well-supported clades, here termed POA and XMMAS. The POA clade, containing Prionopelta, Onychomyrmex and Amblyopone, is well resolved internally, and its structure supports synonymy of the genus Concoctio under Prionopelta (syn.n.). The XMMAS clade comprises two well-supported groups: (i) a predominantly Neotropical clade, for which we resurrect the genus name Fulakora (stat.r., stat.n.), with junior synonyms Paraprionopelta (syn.n.) and Ericapelta (syn.n.); and (ii) the remaining taxa, or ‘core XMMAS', which are manifested in our study as a poorly resolved bush of about a dozen lineages, suggesting rapid radiation at the time of their origin. Most of these XMMAS lineages have been assigned to the catch-all genus Stigmatomma, but the more distinctive elements have been treated as separate genera (Xymmer, Mystrium, Myopopone and Adetomyrma). Resolution of basal relationships in the core XMMAS clade and reconfiguration of ‘Stigmatomma' to restore monophyly of all named genera will require more extensive genetic data and additional morphological analysis. However, the genus Bannapone can be synonymized under Stigmatomma (syn.n.) because it is embedded within a clade that contains S. denticulatum, the type species of Stigmatomma. Divergence dating analysis indicates that crown Amblyoponinae arose in the mid-Cretaceous, about 107 Ma (95{\%} highest probability density: 93–121 Ma). The POA and XMMAS clades have estimated crown ages of 47 and 73 Ma, respectively. The initial burst of diversification in the core XMMAS clade occurred in the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene (50–60 Ma). Ancestral range reconstruction suggests that amblyoponines originated in the Afrotropics, and dispersed to the Indo-Malayan region and to the New World. During none of these dispersal events did the ants break out of their cryptobiotic lifestyle.},

abstract = {In an era of biodiversity crisis, arthropods have great potential to inform conservation assessment and test hypotheses about community assembly. This is because their relatively narrow geographic distributions and high diversity offer high-resolution data on landscape-scale patterns of biodiversity. However, a major impediment to the more widespread application of arthropod data to a range of scientific and policy questions is the poor state of modern arthropod taxonomy, especially in the tropics. Inventories of spiders and other megadiverse arthropods from tropical forests are dominated by undescribed species. Such studies typically organize their data using morphospecies codes, which make it difficult for data from independent inventories to be compared and combined. To combat this shortcoming, we offer cyberdiversity, an online community-based approach for reconciling results of independent inventory studies where current taxonomic knowledge is incomplete. Participating scientists can upload images and DNA barcode sequences to dedicated databases and submit occurrence data and links to a web site (www.digitalSpiders.org). Taxonomic determinations can be shared with a crowdsourcing comments feature, and researchers can discover specimens of interest available for loan and request aliquots of genomic DNA extract. To demonstrate the value of the cyberdiversity framework, we reconcile data from three rapid structured inventories of spiders conducted in Vietnam with an independent inventory (Doi Inthanon, Thailand) using online image libraries. Species richness and inventory completeness were assessed using non-parametric estimators. Community similarity was evaluated using a novel index based on the Jaccard replacing observed with estimated values to correct for unobserved species. We use a distance-decay framework to demonstrate a rudimentary model of landscape-scale changes in community composition that will become increasingly informative as additional inventories participate. With broader adoption of the cyberdiversity approach, networks of information-sharing taxonomists can more efficiently and effectively address taxonomic impediments while elucidating landscape scale patterns of biodiversity.},

Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two biodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using {\textgreater}1,600 samples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous plant studies, we assessed to what extent a "DNA barcoding gap" is present between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple accessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy amplification, and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK gene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we further demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories. In addition, analyzing {\textgreater}1,000 species of Mesoamerican orchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and proves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes.},

In order to have an overview of the molecular diversity of the O. huwena venom, the datasets of all the transcripts, peptides and proteins known so far were analyzed. A comparison of the data obtained through a proteomic versus a transcriptomic approach, revealed that only 15 putative cystine knot toxins (CKTs) were identified by both approaches, 29 transcripts coding for CKTs were found in the transcriptome but not as translated peptides in the venom proteome. However, no cellular protein with identical molecular weight was identified by both approaches. Our data may contribute to a deeper understanding of the biology and ecology of O. huwena and the relationship between structure and function of individual toxins. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many scientific disciplines rely on correct taxon delineations and identifications. So does a great part of the general public as well as decision makers. Researchers, students and enthusiastic amateurs often feel frustrated because information about species remains scattered, difficult to access, or difficult to decipher. Together, this affects almost anyone who wishes to identify species or verify identifications. Many remedies have been proposed, but we argue that the role of natural history collections remains insufficiently appreciated. We suggest using state-of-the-art mass imaging technology and to join forces to create a global natural history metacollection on the internet, providing access to the morphology of tens of millions of specimens and making them available for automated digital image analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Robotic high-resolution imaging technology and fast (high performance) computer-based image stitching make it now feasible to digitize entire collection drawers typically used for arthropod collections, or trays or containers used for other objects. Resolutions of 500 megapixels and much higher are already utilized to capture the contents of 40x50 cm collection drawers, providing amazing detail of specimens. Flanked by metadata entry, this helps to create access to tens of thousands of specimens in days. By setting priorities and combining the holdings of the most comprehensive collections for certain taxa, drawer digitizing offers the unique opportunity to create a global, virtual metacollection.The taxonomic and geographic coverage of such a collection could never be achieved by a single institution or individual. We argue that by joining forces, many new impulses will emerge for systematic biology, related fields and understanding of biodiversity in general.Digitizing drawers containing unidentified, little-curated specimens is a contribution towards the beginning of a new era of online curation. It also will help taxonomists and curators to discover and process the millions of "gems" of undescribed species hidden in museum accessions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Our proposal suggests creating virtual, high-resolution image resources that will, for the first time in history, provide access for expert scientists as well as students and the general public to the enormous wealth of the world's natural history collections. We foresee that this will contribute to a better understanding, appreciation and increased use of biodiversity resources and the natural history collections serving this cause.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction can lead to major conflicts between sexes and within genomes. Here we report an extreme case of such conflicts in the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata. We found that sterile workers are produced by normal sexual reproduction, whereas daughter queens are invariably clonally produced. Because males usually develop from unfertilized maternal eggs in ants and other haplodiploid species, they normally achieve direct fitness only through diploid female offspring. Hence, although the clonal production of queens increases the queen's relatedness to reproductive daughters, it potentially reduces male reproductive success to zero. In an apparent response to this conflict between sexes, genetic analyses reveal that males reproduce clonally, most likely by eliminating the maternal half of the genome in diploid eggs. As a result, all sons have nuclear genomes identical to those of their father. The obligate clonal production of males and queens from individuals of the same sex effectively results in a complete separation of the male and female gene pools. These findings show that the haplodiploid sex-determination system provides grounds for the evolution of extraordinary genetic systems and new types of sexual conflict.},

Habitat loss is widely used as a measurement of the risk of extinction, but because many coastal species are migratory, the impact of habitat loss will depend not only on its extent, but also on where it occurs. Here, we develop a novel graph-theoretic approach to measure the vulnerability of a migratory network to the impact of habitat loss from SLR based on population flow through the network. We show that reductions in population flow far exceed the proportion of habitat lost for 10 long-distance migrant shorebirds using the East Asian–Australasian Flyway. We estimate that SLR will inundate 23–40{\%} of intertidal habitat area along their migration routes, but cause a reduction in population flow of up to 72 per cent across the taxa. This magnifying effect was particularly strong for taxa whose migration routes contain bottlenecks—sites through which a large fraction of the population travels. We develop the bottleneck index, a new network metric that positively correlates with the predicted impacts of habitat loss on overall population flow. Our results indicate that migratory species are at greater risk than previously realized.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Enormous molecular sequence data have been accumulated over the last years and are still exponentially growing through faster and cheaper sequencing techniques. There is high and widespread interest in using these data for phylogenetic analyses. However, the amount of data that one can retrieve from public sequence repositories is virtually impossible to tame without dedicated software that automates processes. Here, we present a novel bioinformatic pipeline for downloading, formatting, filtering, and analyzing public sequence data deposited in GenBank. It combines some well-established programs with numerous newly developed software tools (available from http://software.zfmk.de). RESULTS: We used the pipeline to investigate the phylogeny of the megadiverse insect order Hymenoptera (sawflies, bees, wasps, and ants) by retrieving and processing more than 120,000 sequences and by selecting subsets under the criteria of compositional homogeneity and defined levels of density and overlap. Tree reconstruction was done with a partitioned maximum likelihood analysis from a supermatrix with more than 80,000 sites and more than 1,100 species. In the inferred tree, consistent with previous studies, 'Symphyta' is paraphyletic. Within Apocrita, our analysis suggests a topology of Stephanoidea + (Ichneumonoidea + (Proctotrupomorpha + (Evanioidea + Aculeata))). Despite the huge amount of data, we identified several persistent problems in the Hymenoptera tree; data coverage is still extremely low and additional data have to be collected to reliably infer the phylogeny of Hymenoptera. CONCLUSIONS: While we applied our pipeline to Hymenoptera, we designed the approach as general as possible. With this pipeline, it is possible to produce phylogenetic trees for any taxonomic group and to monitor new data and tree robustness in a taxon of interest. It therefore has great potential to meet the challenges of the phylogenomic era, and to deepen our understanding of the tree of life.},

abstract = {Estrogen Receptor alpha and beta (ER-{\$}\backslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}and -{\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}) are members of the nuclear receptor family of transcriptional regulators with distinct roles in mediating estrogen dependent breast cancer cell growth and differentiation. Following activation by the hormone, these proteins undergo conformation changes and accumulate in the nucleus, where they bind to chromatin at regulatory sites as homo- and/or heterodimers and assemble in large multiprotein complexes. Although the two ERs share a conserved structure, they exert specific and distinct functional roles in normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells and other cell types. To investigate the molecular bases of such differences, we performed a comparative computational analysis of the nuclear interactomes of the two ER subtypes, exploiting two datasets of receptor interacting proteins identified in breast cancer cell nuclei by Tandem Affinity Purification for their ability to associate in vivo with ligand-activated ER-{\$}\backslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}and/or ER-{\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}. These datasets comprise 498 proteins, of which only 70 are common to both ERs, suggesting that differences in the nature of the two ER interactomes are likely to sustain the distinct roles of the two receptor subtypes. Functional characterization of the two interactomes and their topological analysis, considering node degree and closeness of the networks, confirmed this possibility. Indeed, clustering and network dissection highlighted the presence of distinct and ER subtype-specific subnetworks endowed with defined functions. Altogether, these data provide new insights on the protein-protein interaction networks controlled by ER-{\$}\backslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}and -{\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}that mediate their ability to transduce estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells.},

Ideally, researchers would conduct genome-scale screening of museum specimens to explore the evolutionary consequences of environmental changes, but to date such analyses have been severely limited by the numerous challenges of working with the highly degraded DNA typical of historic samples. Here, we circumvent these challenges by using custom, multiplexed, exon capture to enrich and sequence {\~{}}11,000 exons ({\~{}}4 Mb) from early 20th-century museum skins. We used this approach to test for changes in genomic diversity accompanying a climate-related range retraction in the alpine chipmunks (Tamias alpinus) in the high Sierra Nevada area of California, USA. We developed robust bioinformatic pipelines that rigorously detect and filter out base misincorporations in DNA derived from skins, most of which likely resulted from postmortem damage. Furthermore, to accommodate genotyping uncertainties associated with low-medium coverage data, we applied a recently developed probabilistic method to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and estimate allele frequencies and the joint site frequency spectrum. Our results show increased genetic subdivision following range retraction, but no change in overall genetic diversity at either nonsynonymous or synonymous sites. This case study showcases the advantages of integrating emerging genomic and statistical tools in museum collection-based population genomic applications. Such technical advances greatly enhance the value of museum collections, even where a pre-existing reference is lacking and points to a broad range of potential applications in evolutionary and conservation biology.},

abstract = {Background: Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector of tick-borne diseases in Europe. A better knowledge of its genome and transcriptome is important for developing control strategies. Previous transcriptomic studies of I. ricinus have focused on gene expression during the blood meal in specific tissues. To obtain a broader picture of changes in gene expression during the blood meal, our study analysed the transcriptome at the level of the whole body for both nymphal and adult ticks. Ixodes ricinus ticks from a highly inbred colony at the University of Neuch{\^{a}}tel were used. We also analysed previously published RNAseq studies to compare the genetic variation between three wild strains and three laboratory strains, including the strain from Neuch{\^{a}}tel. Results: RNA was extracted from whole tick bodies and the cDNA was sequenced, producing 162,872,698 paired-end reads. Our reference transcriptome contained 179,316 contigs, of which 31{\%} were annotated using Trinotate. Gene expression was compared between ticks that differed by feeding status (unfed vs partially fed). We found that blood-feeding in nymphs and female adult ticks increased the expression of cuticle-associated genes. Using a set of 3866 single nucleotide polymorphisms to calculate the heterozygosity, we found that the wild tick populations of I. ricinus had much higher levels of heterozygosity than the three laboratory populations. Conclusion: Using high throughput strand-oriented sequencing for whole ticks in different stages and feeding conditions, we obtained a de novo assembly that significantly increased the genomic resources available for I. ricinus. Our study illustrates the importance of analysing the transcriptome at the level of the whole body to gain additional insights into how gene expression changes over the life-cycle of an organism. Our comparison of several RNAseq datasets shows the power of transcriptomic data to accurately characterize genetic polymorphism and for comparing different populations or sources of sequencing material.},

abstract = {Background: Cubozoans (box jellyfish) are cnidarians that have evolved a number of distinguishing features. Many cubozoans have a particularly potent sting, effected by stinging structures called nematocysts; cubozoans have well-developed light sensation, possessing both image-forming lens eyes and light-sensitive eye spots; and some cubozoans have complex mating behaviors, including aggregations, copulation and internal fertilization. The cubozoan Alatina alata is emerging as a cnidarian model because it forms predictable monthly nearshore breeding aggregations in tropical to subtropical waters worldwide, making both adult and larval material reliably accessible. To develop resources for A. alata, this study generated a functionally annotated transcriptome of adult and larval tissue, applying preliminary differential expression analyses to identify candidate genes involved in nematogenesis and venom production, vision and extraocular sensory perception, and sexual reproduction, which for brevity we refer to as "venom", "vision" and "sex". Results: We assembled a transcriptome de novo from RNA-Seq data pooled from multiple body parts (gastric cirri, ovaries, tentacle (with pedalium base) and rhopalium) of an adult female A. alata medusa and larval planulae. Our transcriptome comprises {\~{}}32 K transcripts, after filtering, and provides a basis for analyzing patterns of gene expression in adult and larval box jellyfish tissues. Furthermore, we annotated a large set of candidate genes putatively involved in venom, vision and sex, providing an initial molecular characterization of these complex features in cubozoans. Expression profiles and gene tree reconstruction provided a number of preliminary insights into the putative sites of nematogenesis and venom production, regions of phototransduction activity and fertilization dynamics in A. alata. Conclusions: Our Alatina alata transcriptome significantly adds to the genomic resources for this emerging cubozoan model. This study provides the first annotated transcriptome from multiple tissues of a cubozoan focusing on both the adult and larvae. Our approach of using multiple body parts and life stages to generate this transcriptome effectively identified a broad range of candidate genes for the further study of coordinated processes associated with venom, vision and sex. This new genomic resource and the candidate gene dataset are valuable for further investigating the evolution of distinctive features of cubozoans, and of cnidarians more broadly.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction can lead to major conflicts between sexes and within genomes. Here we report an extreme case of such conflicts in the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata. We found that sterile workers are produced by normal sexual reproduction, whereas daughter queens are invariably clonally produced. Because males usually develop from unfertilized maternal eggs in ants and other haplodiploid species, they normally achieve direct fitness only through diploid female offspring. Hence, although the clonal production of queens increases the queen's relatedness to reproductive daughters, it potentially reduces male reproductive success to zero. In an apparent response to this conflict between sexes, genetic analyses reveal that males reproduce clonally, most likely by eliminating the maternal half of the genome in diploid eggs. As a result, all sons have nuclear genomes identical to those of their father. The obligate clonal production of males and queens from individuals of the same sex effectively results in a complete separation of the male and female gene pools. These findings show that the haplodiploid sex-determination system provides grounds for the evolution of extraordinary genetic systems and new types of sexual conflict.},

abstract = {The Gp-9 gene in fire ants represents an important model system for studying the evolution of social organization in insects as well as a rich source of information relevant to other major evolutionary topics. An important feature of this system is that polymorphism in social organization is completely associated with allelic variation at Gp-9, such that single-queen colonies (monogyne form) include only inhabitants bearing B-like alleles while multiple-queen colonies (polygyne form) additionally include inhabitants bearing b-like alleles. A recent study of this system by Leal and Ishida (2008) made two major claims, the validity and significance of which we examine here. After reviewing existing literature, analyzing the methods and results of Leal and Ishida (2008), and generating new data from one of their study sites, we conclude that their claim that polygyny can occur in Solenopsis invicta in the U.S.A. in the absence of expression of the b-like allele Gp-9(b) is unfounded. Moreover, we argue that available information on insect OBPs (the family of proteins to which GP-9 belongs), on the evolutionary/population genetics of Gp-9, and on pheromonal/behavioral control of fire ant colony queen number fails to support their view that GP-9 plays no role in the chemosensory-mediated communication that underpins regulation of social organization. Our analyses lead us to conclude that there are no new reasons to question the existing consensus view of the Gp-9 system outlined in Gotzek and Ross (2007).},

abstract = {Background: Spiders (Order Araneae) are essential predators in every terrestrial ecosystem largely because they have evolved potent arsenals of silk and venom. Spider silks are high performance materials made almost entirely of proteins, and thus represent an ideal system for investigating genome level evolution of novel protein functions. However, genomic level resources remain limited for spiders. Results: We de novo assembled a transcriptome for the Western black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) from deeply sequenced cDNAs of three tissue types. Our multi-tissue assembly contained {\~{}}100,000 unique transcripts, of which {\textgreater}27,000 were annotated by homology. Comparing transcript abundance among the different tissues, we identified 647 silk gland-specific transcripts, including the few known silk fiber components (e.g. six spider fibroins, spidroins). Silk gland specific transcripts are enriched compared to the entire transcriptome in several functions, including protein degradation, inhibition of protein degradation, and oxidation-reduction. Phylogenetic analyses of 37 gene families containing silk gland specific transcripts demonstrated novel gene expansions within silk glands, and multiple co-options of silk specific expression from paralogs expressed in other tissues. Conclusions: We propose a transcriptional program for the silk glands that involves regulating gland specific synthesis of silk fiber and glue components followed by protecting and processing these components into functional fibers and glues. Our black widow silk gland gene repertoire provides extensive expansion of resources for biomimetic applications of silk in industry and medicine. Furthermore, our multi-tissue transcriptome facilitates evolutionary analysis of arachnid genomes and adaptive protein systems. {\textcopyright}2014 Clarke et al.},

Recent investigations have revealed the important role of gene body methylation in regulating gene expression in response to intrinsic and environmental factors.

The approach has been extended by the development of new methods, including model-based techniques for analyzing heterogeneous data and hierarchical methods for constructing extremely large trees.

abstract = {In this paper we describe the nearly complete mitochondrial genome of the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata, assembled using transcriptomic libraries from Sanger and Illumina next generation sequencing (NGS), and PCR products. This mitogenome was found to be very large (18,729 bp), given the presence of 30 non-coding intergenic spacers (IGS) spanning 3,808 bp. A portion of the putative control region remained unsequenced. The gene content and organization correspond to that inferred for the ancestral pancrustacea, except for two tRNA gene rearrangements that have been described previously in other ants. The IGS were highly variable in length and dispersed through the mitogenome. This pattern was also found for the other hymenopterans in particular for the monophyletic Apocrita. These spacers with unknown function may be valuable for characterizing genome evolution and distinguishing closely related species and individuals. NGS provided better coverage than Sanger sequencing, especially for tRNA and ribosomal subunit genes, thus facilitating efforts to fill in sequence gaps. The results obtained showed that data from transcriptomic libraries contain valuable information for assembling mitogenomes. The present data also provide a source of molecular markers that will be very important for improving our understanding of genomic evolutionary processes and phylogenetic relationships among hymenopterans.},

abstract = {Gnamptogenys triangularis (Mayr), native to the forests of South and Central America, is a predatory ant that feeds on millipedes. In its native range, this species is known from Buenos Aires, Argentina (38.1°S) in the south to Costa Rica (10.4°N) in the north, with records from eight countries in South America (all except Chile, French Guiana, and Paraguay), and the two southernmost countries of Central America (Panama and Costa Rica). The first records of G. triangularis outside its native range came from Florida beginning in 1985 (six sites: 25.5°–30.4°N) and Alabama in 1996 (one site: 30.4°N). Here we present the first records of G. triangularis from Mississippi, dating from 2002–2010 (five sites: 30.5°–31.2°N). Based on its South American range, it appears that G. triangularis has the potential to spread to forests throughout much of the southeastern USA. There are no documented impacts of G. triangularis, and it seems unlikely that this species will ever become a major pest.},

abstract = {A phylogenetic tree at the species level is still far off for highly diverse insect orders, including the Coleoptera, but the taxonomic breadth of public sequence databases is growing. In addition, new types of data may contribute to increasing taxon coverage, such as metagenomic shotgun sequencing for assembly of mitogenomes from bulk specimen samples. The current study explores the application of these techniques for large-scale efforts to build the tree of Coleoptera. We used shotgun data from 17 different ecological and taxonomic datasets (5 unpublished) to assemble a total of 1942 mitogenome contigs of {\textgreater}3000 bp. These sequences were combined into a single dataset together with all mitochondrial data available at GenBank, in addition to nuclear markers widely used in molecular phylogenetics. The resulting matrix of nearly 16000 species with two or more loci produced trees (RAxML) showing overall congruence with the Linnaean taxonomy at hierarchical levels from suborders to genera. We tested the role of full-length mitogenomes in stabilizing the tree from GenBank data, as mitogenomes might link terminals with non-overlapping gene representation. However, the mitogenome data were only partly useful in this respect, presumably because of the purely automated approach to assembly and gene delimitation, but improvements in future may be possible by using multiple assemblers and manual curation. In conclusion, the combination of data mining and metagenomic sequencing of bulk samples provided the largest phylogenetic tree of Coleoptera to date, which represents a summary of existing phylogenetic knowledge and a defensible tree of great utility, in particular for studies at the intra-familial level, despite some shortcomings for resolving basal nodes.},

In light of this relatively new and rapidly increasing resource, we critically review its utility and limitations for addressing a diverse array of applications. When integrated with spatial environmental data, NHC data can be used to study a broad range of topics, from aspects of ecological and evolutionary theory, to applications in conservation, agriculture and human health. There are challenges inherent to using NHC data, such as taxonomic inaccuracies and biases in the spatial coverage of data, which require consideration.

To examine the worldwide distribution of P. alluaudi, I compiled and mapped published and unpublished specimen records from {\textgreater} 450 sites. I documented the earliest known P. alluaudi records for 46 geographic areas (coun- tries, island groups, and US states), including several areas for which I found no previously published records: Anguilla, Barbados, Comoros Islands, Grenada, Guadeloupe, {\^{I}}les Eparses, Martinique, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, and St. Martin. Plagiolepis alluaudi is a primarily tropical species, apparently native to Madagascar and neighboring islands. It has be- come a pest on Pacific islands and in European greenhouses. Before the present study, the only published reports of P. alluaudi in the New World were several records from Bermuda and one record from California. Recent surveys in Ber- muda and California have produced no additional reports of P. alluaudi. My new records of P. alluaudi from nine tropical islands in the West Indies indicate a substantial New World invasion. It may be that the tropical climate of the West Indies is more suitable for P. alluaudi than the subtropical climates of Bermuda and California, where it may have died out.},

abstract = {Symbiosis—the close and often long-term interaction of species—is predicted to drive genome evolution in a variety of ways. For example, parasitic interactions have been shown to increase rates of molecular evolution, a trend generally attributed to the Red Queen Hypothesis. However, it is much less clear how mutualisms impact the genome, as both increased and reduced rates of change have been predicted. Here we sequence the genomes of seven species of ants, three that have convergently evolved obligate plant–ant mutualism and four closely related species of non-mutualists. Comparing these sequences, we investi- gate how genome evolution is shaped by mutualistic behaviour. We find that rates of molecular evolution are higher in the mutualists genome wide, a characteristic apparently not the result of demography. Our results suggest that the intimate relationships of obligate mutualists may lead to selective pressures similar to those seen in parasites, thereby increasing rates of evolution. 1Committee},

abstract = {The phorid fly, Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier, is a parasitoid of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren. This fly has been reported to use fire ant chemicals, specifically venom alkaloids and possibly alarm pheromone to locate its host. A recent study identified 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethyl pyrazine as a component of the alarm pheromone of S. invicta. To determine the possible involvement of this fire ant alarm pheromone component in mediating fire ant-phorid fly interactions, we tested electroantennogram (EAG) and behavioral responses of P. tricuspis females to the commercially available mixture of 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethyl pyrazine and its 3,5-dimethyl isomer, as well as six structurally related alkylpyrazine analogs at varying doses. Pseudacteon tricuspis females showed significant EAG response to 2-ethyl-3,6(or 5)-dimethyl pyrazine (herein referred to as pheromone-isomer) at all doses, 0.001-10 $\mu$g. Among the tested alkylpyrazine analogs, 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine showed significant EAG activity at 0.1 and 1 $\mu$g. 2,3-dimethyl pyrazine also showed significant EAG activity at 0.1 $\mu$g. Results of four-choice olfactometer bioassays demonstrated significant attraction of P. tricuspis females to the pheromone-isomer (2-ethyl-3,6(or 5)-dimethyl pyrazine) at all tested doses (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 $\mu$g). The analogs, 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine and 2,3-dimethyl pyrazine were significantly better than the control at the higher doses (0.1, 1 and 10 $\mu$g). The pheromone-isomer was significantly better than both analogs at two doses, 0.1 and 1 $\mu$g. These results confirm that the reported fire ant alarm pheromone component plays a role in mediating attraction of phorid flies to host workers. Venom alkaloids were previously shown to attract P. tricuspis; therefore, we propose that fire ant alarm pheromones may act in tandem or synergistically with venom alkaloids to attract phorid fly parasitoids to fire ant workers. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since Darwin's Origin of Species, reconstructing the Tree of Life has been a goal of evolutionists, and tree-thinking has become a major concept of evolutionary biology. Practically, building the Tree of Life has proven to be tedious. Too few morphological characters are useful for conducting conclusive phylogenetic analyses at the highest taxonomic level. Consequently, molecular sequences (genes, proteins, and genomes) likely constitute the only useful characters for constructing a phylogeny of all life. For this reason, tree-makers expect a lot from gene comparisons. The simultaneous study of the largest number of molecular markers possible is sometimes considered to be one of the best solutions in reconstructing the genealogy of organisms. This conclusion is a direct consequence of tree-thinking: if gene inheritance conforms to a tree-like model of evolution, sampling more of these molecules will provide enough phylogenetic signal to build the Tree of Life. The selection of congruent markers is thus a fundamental step in simultaneous analysis of many genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Heat map analyses were used to investigate the congruence of orthologues in four datasets (archaeal, bacterial, eukaryotic and alpha-proteobacterial). We conclude that we simply cannot determine if a large portion of the genes have a common history. In addition, none of these datasets can be considered free of lateral gene transfer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our phylogenetic analyses do not support tree-thinking. These results have important conceptual and practical implications. We argue that representations other than a tree should be investigated in this case because a non-critical concatenation of markers could be highly misleading.},

abstract = {Archaeogenomic studies have largely elucidated human population history in West Eurasia during the Stone Age. However, despite being a broad geographical region of significant cultural and linguistic diversity, little is known about the population history in North Asia. We present complete mitochondrial genome sequences together with stable isotope data for 41 serially sampled ancient individuals from North Asia, dated between c.13,790 BP and c.1,380 BP extending from the Palaeolithic to the Iron Age. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences and haplogroup data of these individuals revealed the highest genetic affinity to present-day North Asian populations of the same geographical region suggesting a possible long-term maternal genetic continuity in the region. We observed a decrease in genetic diversity over time and a reduction of maternal effective population size (Ne) approximately seven thousand years before present. Coalescent simulations were consistent with genetic continuity between present day individuals and individuals dating to 7,000 BP, 4,800 BP or 3,000 BP. Meanwhile, genetic differences observed between 7,000 BP and 3,000 BP as well as between 4,800 BP and 3,000 BP were inconsistent with genetic drift alone, suggesting gene flow into the region from distant gene pools or structure within the population. These results indicate that despite some level of continuity between ancient groups and present-day populations, the region exhibits a complex demographic history during the Holocene.},

abstract = {The advent of Next Generation Sequencing has reduced sequencing costs and increased genomic projects from a huge amount of organismal taxa, generating an unprecedented amount of genomic datasets publicly available. Often, only a tiny fraction of outstanding relevance of the genomic data produced by researchers is used in their works. This fact allows the data generated to be recycled in further projects worldwide. The assembly of complete mitogenomes is frequently overlooked though it is useful to understand evolutionary relationships among taxa, especially those presenting poor mtDNA sampling at the level of genera and families. This is exactly the case for ants (Hymenoptera:Formicidae) and more specifically for the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae, a group of arboreal ants with several cases of convergent coevolution without any complete mitochondrial sequence available. In this work, we assembled, annotated and performed comparative genomics analyses of 14 new complete mitochondria from Pseudomyrmecinae species relying solely on public datasets available from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We used all complete mitogenomes available for ants to study the gene order conservation and also to generate two phylogenetic trees using both (i) concatenated set of 13 mitochondrial genes and (ii) the whole mitochondrial sequences. Even though the tree topologies diverged subtly from each other (and from previous studies), our results confirm several known relationships and generate new evidences for sister clade classification inside Pseudomyrmecinae clade. We also performed a synteny analysis for Formicidae and identified possible sites in which nucleotidic insertions happened in mitogenomes of pseudomyrmecine ants. Using a data mining/bioinformatics approach, the current work increased the number of complete mitochondrial genomes available for ants from 15 to 29, demonstrating the unique potential of public databases for mitogenomics studies. The wide applications of mitogenomes in research and presence of mitochondrial data in different public dataset types makes the “no budget mitogenomics” approach ideal for comprehensive molecular studies, especially for subsampled taxa.},

Genomics, fueled by declining sequencing costs, offers novel tools with increased precision for genetic questions previously answered with a few molecular markers, as well as completely new possibilities. Metabarcoding promises quicker, cheaper, and more accurate assessments of biodiversity in groups that are difficult to assess by traditional methods, while sequencing low-quality DNA extends the range of useable materials to include museum specimens, archeological remains, and environmental samples. Genomic and transcriptomic data can be used to assess the potential of populations to adapt to new challenges. In the near future, gene-editing tools may help endangered species cope with change, while gene drives control unwanted species and help wanted ones. De-extinction has become a serious prospect.},

Orthology and paralogy are key concepts of evolutionary genomics. A clear distinction between orthologs and paralogs is critical for the construction of a robust evolutionary classification of genes and reliable functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Genome comparisons show that orthologous relationships with genes from taxonomically distant species can be established for the majority of the genes from each sequenced genome. This review examines in depth the definitions and subtypes of orthologs and paralogs, outlines the principal methodological approaches employed for identification of orthology and paralogy, and considers evolutionary and functional implications of these concepts.},

Therefore, we present an automated pipeline for fast de novo annotation of mitochondrial protein-coding genes. The annotation is based on enhanced phylogeny-aware hidden Markov models (HMMs). The pipeline builds taxon-specific enhanced multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of already annotated sequences and corresponding HMMs using an approximation of the phylogeny. The MSAs are enhanced by fixing unannotated frameshifts, purging of wrong sequences, and removal of non-conserved columns from both ends. A comparison with reference annotations highlights the high quality of the results. The frameshift correction method predicts a large number of frameshifts, many of which are unknown. A detailed analysis of the frameshifts in nad3 of the Archosauria-Testudines group has been conducted.},

Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions.

abstract = {Venom based research is exploited to find novel candidates for the development of innovative pharmacological tools, drug candidates and new ingredients for cosmetic and agro-chemical industries. Moreover, venomics, as a well-established approach in systems biology, helps to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of the production of such a great molecular biodiversity. Today the advances made in the proteomics, transcriptomics and bioinfor-matics fields, favor venomics, allowing the in depth study of complex matrices and the elucidation even of minor compounds present in minute biological samples. The present study illustrates a rapid and efficient method developed for the elucidation of venom composition based on NextGen mRNA sequencing of venom glands and LC-MS/MS venom prote-ome profiling. The analysis of the comprehensive data obtained was focused on cysteine rich peptide toxins from four spider species originating from phylogenetically distant families for comparison purposes. The studied species were Heteropoda davidbowie (Sparassidae), Poecilotheria formosa (Theraphosidae), Viridasius fasciatus (Viridasiidae) and Latrodectus mactans (Theridiidae). This led to a high resolution profiling of 284 characterized cysteine rich peptides, 111 of which belong to the Inhibitor Cysteine Knot (ICK) structural motif. The analysis of H. davidbowie venom revealed a high richness in term of venom diversity: 95 peptide sequences were identified; out of these, 32 peptides presented the ICK structural motif and could be classified in six distinct families. The profiling of P. formosa venom highlighted the presence of 126 peptide sequences, with 52 ICK toxins belonging to three structural distinct families. V. fasciatus venom was shown to contain 49 peptide sequences, out of which 22 presented the ICK structural motif and were attributed to five families. The venom of L. mactans, until now studied for its large neurotoxins (Latrotoxins), revealed the presence of 14 cysteine rich peptides, out of which five were ICK toxins belonging to the CSTX superfamily. This in depth profiling of distinct ICK peptide families identified across the four spider species highlighted the high conservation of these neurotoxins among spider families.

In contrast, biparental inheritance is common in mussels of the genus Mytilus. Here we present direct evidence that sex and mtDNA inheritance are coupled in Mytilus. Females inherit mtDNA only from their mother, but they transmit it to both daughters and sons. Males inherit mtDNA from both parents, but they transmit to sons only the mtDNA they inherited from their father. In pair matings, this mtDNA inheritance pattern is associated with a strong sex-ratio bias. These findings establish a newly discovered type of cytoplasmic DNA transmission. We also present evidence that the phenomenon breaks down in interspecific hybrids.},

abstract = {Because they house large biodiversity collections and are also research centres with sequencing facilities, natural history museums are well placed to develop DNA barcoding best practices. The main difficulty is generally the vouchering system: it must ensure that all data produced remain attached to the corresponding specimen, from the field to publication in articles and online databases. The Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris is one of the leading laboratories in the Marine Barcode of Life (MarBOL) project, which was used as a pilot programme to include barcode collections for marine molluscs and crustaceans. The system is based on two relational databases. The first one classically records the data (locality and identification) attached to the specimens. In the second one, tissue-clippings, DNA extractions (both preserved in 2D barcode tubes) and PCR data (including primers) are linked to the corresponding specimen. All the steps of the process [sampling event, specimen identification, molecular processing, data submission to Barcode Of Life Database (BOLD) and GenBank] are thus linked together. Furthermore, we have developed several web-based tools to automatically upload data into the system, control the quality of the sequences produced and facilitate the submission to online databases. This work is the result of a joint effort from several teams in the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN), but also from a collaborative network of taxonomists and molecular systematists outside the museum, resulting in the vouchering so far of ∼41,000 sequences and the production of ∼11,000 COI sequences.},

As usually described, this theory posits that mitochondria are the direct descendants of a bacterial endosymbiont that became established at an early stage in a nucleus-containing (but amitochondriate) host cell. Gene sequence data strongly support a monophyletic origin of the mitochondrion from a eubacterial ancestor shared with a subgroup of the alpha-Proteobacteria. However, recent studies of unicellular eukaryotes (protists), some of them little known, have provided insights that challenge the traditional serial endosymbiosis-based view of how the eukaryotic cell and its mitochondrion came to be. These data indicate that the mitochondrion arose in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this organelle originated at essentially the same time as the nuclear component of the eukaryotic cell rather than in a separate, subsequent event.},

abstract = {If one accepts that the fundamental pursuit of genetics is to determine the genotypes that explain phenotypes, the meteoric increase of DNA sequence information applied toward that pursuit has nowhere to go but up. The recent introduction of instruments capable of producing millions of DNA sequence reads in a single run is rapidly changing the landscape of genetics, providing the ability to answer questions with heretofore unimaginable speed. These technologies will provide an inexpensive, genome-wide sequence readout as an endpoint to applications ranging from chromatin immunoprecipitation, mutation mapping and polymorphism discovery to noncoding RNA discovery. Here I survey next-generation sequencing technologies and consider how they can provide a more complete picture of how the genome shapes the organism. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Plagiolepis alluaudi EMERY, 1894 is a tiny Old World ant that has spread to many parts of the world through human commerce. To examine the worldwide distribution of P. alluaudi, I compiled and mapped published and unpublished specimen records from {\textgreater}450 sites. I documented the earliest known P. alluaudi records for 46 geographic areas (coun- tries, island groups, and US states), including several areas for which I found no previously published records: Anguilla, Barbados, Comoros Islands, Grenada, Guadeloupe, {\^{I}}les Eparses, Martinique, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, and St. Martin. Plagiolepis alluaudi is a primarily tropical species, apparently native to Madagascar and neighboring islands. It has be- come a pest on Pacific islands and in European greenhouses. Before the present study, the only published reports of P. alluaudi in the New World were several records from Bermuda and one record from California. Recent surveys in Ber- muda and California have produced no additional reports of P. alluaudi. My new records of P. alluaudi from nine tropical islands in the West Indies indicate a substantial New World invasion. It may be that the tropical climate of the West Indies is more suitable for P. alluaudi than the subtropical climates of Bermuda and California, where it may have died out.},

abstract = {This study investigates the evolutionary history of a hyperdiverse clade, the ant subfamily Myrmicinae (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), based on analyses of a data matrix comprising 251 species and 11 nuclear gene fragments. Under both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of inference, we recover a robust phylogeny that reveals six major clades of Myrmicinae, here treated as newly defined tribes and occurring as a pectinate series: Myrmicini, Pogonomyrmecini trib.n., Stenammini, Solenopsidini, Attini and Crematogastrini. Because we condense the former 25 myrmicine tribes into a new six-tribe scheme, membership in some tribes is now notably different, especially regarding Attini. We demonstrate that the monotypic genus Ankylomyrma is neither in the Myrmicinae nor even a member of the more inclusive formicoid clade—rather it is a poneroid ant, sister to the genus Tatuidris (Agroecomyrmecinae). Several species-rich myrmicine genera are shown to be nonmonophyletic, including Pogonomyrmex, Aphaenogaster, Messor, Monomorium, Pheidole, Temnothorax and Tetramorium. We propose a number of generic synonymies to partially alleviate these problems (senior synonym listed first): Pheidole = Anisopheidole syn.n. = Machomyrma syn.n.; Temnothorax = Chalepoxenus syn.n. = Myrmoxenus syn.n. = Protomognathus syn.n.; Tetramorium = Rhoptromyrmex syn.n. = Anergates syn.n. = Teleutomyrmex syn.n. The genus Veromessor stat.r. is resurrected for the New World species previously placed in Messor; Syllophopsis stat.r. is resurrected from synonymy under Monomorium to contain the species in the hildebrandti group; Trichomyrmex stat.r. is resurrected from synonymy under Monomorium to contain the species in the scabriceps- and destructor-groups; and the monotypic genus Epelysidris stat.r. is reinstated for Monomorium brocha. Bayesian divergence dating indicates that the crown group Myrmicinae originated about 98.6 Ma (95{\%} highest probability density 87.9–109.6 Ma) but the six major clades are considerably younger, with age estimates ranging from 52.3 to 71.1 Ma. Although these and other suprageneric taxa arose mostly in the middle Eocene or earlier, a number of prominent, species-rich genera, such as Pheidole, Cephalotes, Strumigenys, Crematogaster and Tetramorium, have estimated crown group origins in the late Eocene or Oligocene. Most myrmicine species diversity resides in the two sister clades, Attini and Crematogastrini, which are estimated to have originated and diversified extensively in the Neotropics and Paleotropics, respectively. The newly circumscribed Myrmicini is Holarctic in distribution, and ancestral range estimation suggests a Nearctic origin. The Pogonomyrmecini and Solenopsidini are reconstructed as being Neotropical in origin, but they have subsequently colonized the Nearctic region (Pogonomyrmecini) and many parts of the Old World as well as the Nearctic region (Solenopsidini), respectively. The Stenammini have flourished primarily in the northern hemisphere, and are most likely of Nearctic origin, but selected lineages have dispersed to the northern Neotropics and the Paleotropics. Thus the evolutionary history of the Myrmicinae has played out on a global stage over the last 100 Ma, with no single region being the principal generator of species diversity.

abstract = {As sites of cellular respiration and energy production, mitochondria play a central role in cell metabolism. Cell differentiation is associated with an increase in mitochondrial content and activity and with a metabolic shift toward increased oxidative phosphorylation activity. The opposite occurs during reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Studies have provided evidence of mitochondrial and metabolic changes during the differentiation of both embryonic and somatic (or adult) stem cells (SSCs), such as hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and tissue-specific progenitor cells. We thus propose to consider those mitochondrial and metabolic changes as hallmarks of differentiation processes. We review how mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and function are directly involved in embryonic and SSC differentiation and how metabolic and sensing pathways connect mitochondria and metabolism with cell fate and pluripotency. Understanding the basis of the crosstalk between mitochondria and cell fate is of critical importance, given the promising application of stem cells in regenerative medicine. In addition to the development of novel strategies to improve the in vitro lineage-directed differentiation of stem cells, understanding the molecular basis of this interplay could lead to the identification of novel targets to improve the treatment of degenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Conversion of natural forest to oil palm plantations is a major threat to biodiversity in Southeast Asia. The retention of natural forest habitats within plantations has been proposed as a method to reduce biodiversity losses in agricultural areas, and we examined whether forest areas resulted in spillover of species into adjacent oil palm plantations. We sampled ants and butterflies along two 2-km transects across an ecotone from plantation into adjacent forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Species richness of both taxa was reduced in plantations, but to a greater extent in butterflies (54{\%} reduction) than in ants (25{\%} reduction). Butterfly diversity increased in plantations with increasing proximity to forest primarily due to spillover of ‘vagrant' forest species (whose larval host plants do not occur in plantations), although richness of species that could potentially breed in plantations also increased near to forest. By contrast, ants showed no spillover effects and were less sensitive to land-use changes, with much higher levels of similarity in species assemblages across habitats than for butterflies. Our results for butterflies suggest that despite the negative impacts of plantations on diversity, proximity to forest could improve diversity in adjacent plantations for some taxa. Spillover of forest species implies that retaining forest areas within plantations may be important for facilitating dispersal of some species through the landscape.},

abstract = {Symbiosis—the close and often long-term interaction of species—is predicted to drive genome evolution in a variety of ways. For example, parasitic interactions have been shown to increase rates of molecular evolution, a trend generally attributed to the Red Queen Hypothesis. However, it is much less clear how mutualisms impact the genome, as both increased and reduced rates of change have been predicted. Here we sequence the genomes of seven species of ants, three that have convergently evolved obligate plant–ant mutualism and four closely related species of non-mutualists. Comparing these sequences, we investi- gate how genome evolution is shaped by mutualistic behaviour. We find that rates of molecular evolution are higher in the mutualists genome wide, a characteristic apparently not the result of demography. Our results suggest that the intimate relationships of obligate mutualists may lead to selective pressures similar to those seen in parasites, thereby increasing rates of evolution. 1Committee},

abstract = {The African green and bush snakes of the genus Philothamnus currently comprises 21 species and three subspecies and occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The genus has been the subject of previous taxonomic revisions based on traditional morphological characters and limited genetic assessment, and may not reflect their evolutionary history. Indeed, previous findings based on phylogenetics show discordant results of interspecific relationships and question the monophyly of the genus, although taxon sampling has been limited to date. We investigated phylogenetic affinities within Philothamnus with more inclusive genetic and geographical sampling, with the aim of better understanding their evolutionary history, so that future taxonomic revision of Philothamnus can be better informed. Species relationships were examined within a phylogenetic context and sampling included 133 ingroup samples from 16 taxa. Phylogenies were constructed in Bayesian and likelihood frameworks using three mitochondrial (16S, cyt b and ND4) and two nuclear (c-mos and RAG1) markers. Competing hypotheses relating to the monophyly of the genus were tested with a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. To examine species boundaries, Bayesian General Mixed Yule-Coalescent Model and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes analyses were conducted. In addition, a barcoding approach was used to further clarify species-level relationships by comparing frequency distributions between intra- and interspecific sequence divergence. The genus was recovered as monophyletic; however, species-delimitation results suggest that the current taxonomy does not reflect the evolutionary history of this group. For example, Philothamnus s. semivariegatus is paraphyletic, with at least four distinct clades. Philothamnus carinatus consists of two cryptic (sister) lineages from Central and West Africa that are deeply divergent, suggesting a long history of isolation between those regions. Furthermore, the subspecies P. n. natalensis and P. n. occidentalis show strong support for species-level divergence, which reflects their morphological and ecological differences. Accordingly, we elevate P. occidentalis nov. comb. to a full species. A fully informed taxonomic revision of these taxa will require additional morphological and ecological data for corroboration, but it seems that the morphological characters (e.g. scalation, dentition) used to describe these species to date are labile within and between species. This most likely has clouded our understanding of the species boundaries within the genus. Our phylogeny and species-delimitation analyses should provide a sounder framework for taxonomy, but may also prove useful toward understanding the morphological adaptations of these species to their respective habitats.},

abstract = {We investigated phylogenetic relationships among the ‘primitive' Australian ant genera Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia (stat. rev.) and the Baltic amber fossil genus Prionomyrmex, using a combination of morphological and molecular data. Outgroups for the analysis included representatives from a variety of potential sister-groups, including five extant subfamilies of ants and one extinct group (Sphecomyrminae). Parsimony analysis of the morphological data provides strong support ({\~{}}95{\%} bootstrap proportions) for the monophyly of (1) genus Myrmecia, (2) genus Prionomyrmex, and (3) a clade containing those two genera plus Nothomyrmecia. A group comprising Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex is also upheld (85{\%} bootstrap support). Molecular sequence data ({\~{}}2200 base pairs from the 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes) corroborate these findings for extant taxa, with Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia appearing as sister-groups with {\~{}}100{\%} bootstrap support under parsimony, neighbour-joining and maximum-likelihood analyses. Neither the molecular nor the morphological data set allows us to identify unambiguously the sister-group of (Myrmecia + (Nothomyrmecia + Prionomyrmex)). Rather, Myrmecia and relatives are part of an unresolved polytomy that encompasses most of the ant subfamilies. Taken as a whole, our results support the contention that many of the major lineages of ants – including a clade that later came to contain Myrmecia, Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex – arose at around the same time during a bout of diversification in the middle or late Cretaceous. On the basis of Bayesian dating analysis, the estimated age of the most recent common ancestor of Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia is 74 million years (95{\%} confidence limits, 53–101 million years), a result consistent with the origin of the myrmeciine stem lineage in the Cretaceous. The ant subfamily Myrmeciinae is redefined to contain two tribes, Myrmeciini (genus Myrmecia) and Prionomyrmecini (Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex). Phylogenetic analysis of the enigmatic Argentine fossils Ameghinoia and Polanskiella demonstrates that they are also members of the Myrmeciinae, probably more closely related to Prionomyrmecini than to Myrmeciini. Thus, the myrmeciine ants appear to be a formerly widespread group that retained many ancestral formicid characteristics and that became extinct everywhere except in the Australian region.},

abstract = {De novo genome sequence assembly is important both to generate new sequence assemblies for previously uncharac- terized genomes and to identify the genome sequence of individuals in a reference-unbiased way. We present memory efficient data structures and algorithms for assembly using the FM-index derived from the compressed Burrows-Wheeler transform, and a new assembler based on these called SGA (String Graph Assembler). We describe algorithms to error- correct, assemble, and scaffold large sets of sequence data. SGA uses the overlap-based string graph model of assembly, unlike most de novo assemblers that rely on de Bruijn graphs, and is simply parallelizable. We demonstrate the error correction and assembly performance of SGA on 1.2 billion sequence reads from a human genome, which we are able to assemble using 54 GB of memory. The resulting contigs are highly accurate and contiguous, while covering 95{\%} of the reference genome (excluding contigs {\textless}200 bp in length). Because of the low memory requirements and parallelization without requiring inter-process communication, SGA provides the first practical assembler to our knowledge for a mammalian-sized genome on a low-end computing cluster.},

This phenomenon, frequently termed the Allee effect, has been the focus of increased interest over the past two decades in the light of concerns over conservation and the problems of rarity. Use of the term suffers from the absence of a clear definition however, with the result that Alice effects are frequently thought to involve only a narrow range of phenomena and are often overlooked altogether. We propose a definition for the effect and attempt to resolve the major issues underlying the confusion surrounding this term.},

abstract = {Insect societies dominate the natural world: They mould landscapes, sculpt habitats, pollinate plants, sow seeds and control pests. The secret to their success lies in the evolution of queen (reproductive) and worker (provisioner and carer) castes (Oster {\&} Wilson ). A major problem in evolutionary biology is explaining the evolution of insect castes, particularly the workers (Darwin ). Next-generation sequencing technologies now make it possible to understand how genomic material is born, lost and reorganized in the evolution of alternative phenotypes. Such analyses are revealing a general role for novel (e.g. taxonomically restricted) genes in phenotypic innovations across the animal kingdom (Chen et al. 2013). In this issue of molecular ecology, Feldmeyer et al. (2014) provide overwhelming evidence for the importance of novel genes in caste evolution in an ant. Feldmeyer et al.'s study is important and exciting because it cements the role of genomic novelty, as well as conservation, firmly into the molecular jigsaw of social evolution. Evolution is eclectic in its exploitation of both old and new genomic material to generate replicated phenotypic innovations across the tree of life.},

abstract = {Abstract: The rearing environment of farmed animals can affect their behaviour when handled, and therefore needs to be taken into account when selecting for traits such as docility. Therefore, 126 German Landrace and Pietrain×German Landrace pigs were reared in two different production environments (barren (n =47) or slightly enriched (n =79)), both corresponding to commercial conditions. The marginal enrichment included the provision of more toys, an additional feeder type, and a larger number of conspecifics, while space allowance per pig remained equal. Pigs' responses to (a) a novel arena test (NAT), (b) a novel object test (NOT), and (c) weighing, were compared, together with the number of skin lesions (an indicator of aggressiveness). While the differences in behaviour in the NAT were not significant (p {\textgreater}0.1), the differences in the other tests were significant. In the NOT enriched housed pigs contacted the novel object more frequently (p =0.0124) and showed a tendency for a greater total duration of manipulating the novel object (p =0.0641). Furthermore, the pigs housed in enriched environment were calmer at loading onto the scale (p =0.0008), but more agitated on the scale (p {\textless}0.0001). Barren housed pigs had more severe skin lesions (p =0.0074). Correlations between scores from the behaviour tests and the daily weight gain were not significant. However, correlations between the behaviour patterns measured in the tests revealed that pigs which showed more activity in the NAT and NOT were also more active in the other tests. Results indicate that marginal changes in the housing environment affect the behaviour of the pigs. Overall, the activity of barren housed animals seemed to be reduced, as revealed by the behaviour tests. Therefore, the housing environment must be taken into consideration carefully when evaluating the behaviour or indicator traits such as skin lesions for selection purposes in pigs. In addition, results of the present study have implications for animal welfare, showing that marginal enrichment of rearing environment leads to changes in behaviour that may partially be related to improved cognitive and/or physical development of the pigs.

abstract = {Shorebirds (Charadriiformes) are a diverse assemblage of species renowned for their variation in behavior, morphology, and life-history traits, but comparative studies of trait variation remain limited by the lack of a well-supported phylogeny based on DNA sequences. In this study we build upon previous shorebird phylogenies to construct the first sequence-based species-level phylogeny for the Scolopaci, one of three shorebird suborders. We sampled 84 species in the Scolopaci, and collected data for five genes (one nuclear and four mitochondrial) via PCR and sequencing or from GenBank. The phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian inference on a partitioned dataset of 6365 aligned base pairs, and was well-supported except for the radiations within Tringa and Calidris. The shanks and phalaropes are sister to the snipes, woodcocks and dowitchers, which in turn are sister to the sandpipers. The godwits and curlews are successive sister-groups to these clades, and the morphologically disparate taxa (jacanas, painted snipes, seedsnipes, and the Plains-wanderer) are the basal sister-group in the Scolopaci. We show that Tringa, Gallinago, and Calidris are paraphyletic assemblages, and thus are in need of taxonomic revision. The clade of Calidridine sandpipers has very short internal branches indicative of a relatively recent rapid radiation, and will require a gene tree/species tree approach to resolve relationships among species. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The distribution of food resources in space and time is likely to be an important factor governing the type of foraging strategy used by ants. However, no previous systematic attempt has been made to determine whether spatiotemporal resource distribution is in fact correlated with foraging strategy across the ants. In this analysis, I present data compiled from the literature on the foraging strategy and food resource use of 402 species of ants from across the phylogenetic tree. By categorizing the distribution of resources reported in these studies in terms of size relative to colony size, spatial distribution relative to colony foraging range, frequency of occurrence in time relative to worker life span, and depletability (i.e., whether the colony can cause a change in resource frequency), I demonstrate that different foraging strategies are indeed associated with specific spatiotemporal resource attributes. The general patterns I describe here can therefore be used as a framework to inform predictions in future studies of ant foraging behavior. No differences were found between resources collected via short-term recruitment strategies (group recruitment, short-term trails, and volatile recruitment), whereas different resource distributions were associated with solitary foraging, trunk trails, long-term trail networks, group raiding, and raiding. In many cases, ant species use a combination of different foraging strategies to collect diverse resources. It is useful to consider these foraging strategies not as separate options but as modular parts of the total foraging effort of a colony.},

abstract = {The remarkable antiquity, diversity and ecological significance of arthropods have inspired numerous attempts to resolve their deep phylogenetic history, but the results of two decades of intensive molecular phylogenetics have been mixed. The discovery that terrestrial insects (Hexapoda) are more closely related to aquatic Crustacea than to the terrestrial centipedes and millipedes (Myriapoda) was an early, if exceptional, success. More typically, analyses based on limited samples of taxa and genes have generated results that are inconsistent, weakly supported and highly sensitive to analytical conditions. Here we present strongly supported results from likelihood, Bayesian and parsimony analyses of over 41 kilobases of aligned DNA sequence from 62 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes from 75 arthropod species. These species represent every major arthropod lineage, plus five species of tardigrades and onychophorans as outgroups. Our results strongly support Pancrustacea (Hexapoda plus Crustacea) but also strongly favour the traditional morphology-based Mandibulata (Myriapoda plus Pancrustacea) over the molecule-based Paradoxopoda (Myriapoda plus Chelicerata). In addition to Hexapoda, Pancrustacea includes three major extant lineages of 'crustaceans', each spanning a significant range of morphological disparity. These are Oligostraca (ostracods, mystacocarids, branchiurans and pentastomids), Vericrustacea (malacostracans, thecostracans, copepods and branchiopods) and Xenocarida (cephalocarids and remipedes). Finally, within Pancrustacea we identify Xenocarida as the long-sought sister group to the Hexapoda, a result confirming that 'crustaceans' are not monophyletic. These results provide a statistically well-supported phylogenetic framework for the largest animal phylum and represent a step towards ending the often-heated, century-long debate on arthropod relationships.},

Pheidole teneriffana is known from sites scattered across the greater Mediterranean region (North Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, and neighboring islands), though it is unclear which parts of this area constitute its native range. Pheidole teneriffana is known from only a few Old World sites distant from the Med- iterranean region, i.e., Ascension, China, England, St Helena, and South Africa. In the New World, where this species is certainly exotic, there are published P. teneriffana records only from California, Cuba, and Peru. The first records from 11 West Indian islands presented here, all from 2003 or later, suggest that P. teneriffana is actively spreading through this re- gion. Almost all West Indian records of P. teneriffana come from beaches or urban areas. It seems doubtful that P. teneriffana will develop into a major pest species like its congener, the infamous Pheidole megacephala.},

abstract = {Conversion of natural forest to oil palm plantations is a major threat to biodiversity in Southeast Asia. The retention of natural forest habitats within plantations has been proposed as a method to reduce biodiversity losses in agricultural areas, and we examined whether forest areas resulted in spillover of species into adjacent oil palm plantations. We sampled ants and butterflies along two 2-km transects across an ecotone from plantation into adjacent forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Species richness of both taxa was reduced in plantations, but to a greater extent in butterflies (54{\%} reduction) than in ants (25{\%} reduction). Butterfly diversity increased in plantations with increasing proximity to forest primarily due to spillover of ‘vagrant' forest species (whose larval host plants do not occur in plantations), although richness of species that could potentially breed in plantations also increased near to forest. By contrast, ants showed no spillover effects and were less sensitive to land-use changes, with much higher levels of similarity in species assemblages across habitats than for butterflies. Our results for butterflies suggest that despite the negative impacts of plantations on diversity, proximity to forest could improve diversity in adjacent plantations for some taxa. Spillover of forest species implies that retaining forest areas within plantations may be important for facilitating dispersal of some species through the landscape.},

Thirty-four teachers and 876 sixth- through ninth-grade students from 14 states participated in the study. All student groups reported that they would prefer to learn science from a video game rather than from traditional text, laboratory-based, or Internet environments. Chi-square analyses indicated a significant association between reading ability level, disability status, and key areas of interest including students' use of video games outside of school, their perceptions of their scientific abilities, and whether they would pursue a career in the sciences.

We collate this information and then add data from the natural history of the modern fauna to sketch a history of major ecological adaptations at the subfamily level. The key events appear to have been, first, a mid-Cretaceous initial radiation in forest ground litter and soil coincident with the rise of the angiosperms (flowering plants), then a Paleogene advance to ecological dominance in concert with that of the angiosperms in tropical forests, and, finally, an expansion of some of the lineages, aided by changes in diet away from dependence on predation, upward into the canopy, and outward into more xeric environments.},

abstract = {The discovery of the genetic code and tRNAs as decoders of the code transformed life science. However, after establishing the role of tRNAs in protein synthesis, the field moved to other parts of the RNA world. Now, tRNA research is blooming again, with demonstration of the involvement of tRNAs in various other pathways beyond translation and in adapting translation to environmental cues. These roles are linked to the presence of tRNA sequence variants known as isoacceptors and isodecoders, various tRNA base modifications, the versatility of protein binding partners and tRNA fragmentation events, all of which collectively create an incalculable complexity. This complexity provides a vast repertoire of tRNA species that can serve various functions in cellular homeostasis and in adaptation of cellular functions to changing environments, and it likely arose from the fundamental role of RNAs in early evolution.},

The list comprises 428 taxa in the following categories: ‘Extinct' 20, ‘Threatened' 77 (comprising 24 ‘Nationally Critical', 15 ‘Nationally Endangered', 38 ‘Nationally Vulnerable'), ‘At Risk' 93 (comprising 18 ‘Declining', 10 ‘Recovering', 17 ‘Relict', 48 ‘Naturally Uncommon'), ‘Not Threatened' (native and resident) 36, ‘Coloniser' 8, ‘Migrant' 27, ‘Vagrant' 130, and ‘Introduced and Naturalised' 36. One species was assessed as ‘Data Deficient'. The list uses the New Zealand Threat Classification System, which provides greater resolution of naturally uncommon taxa typical of insular environments than the IUCN threat ranking system. New Zealand taxa are here ranked at subspecies level, and in some cases population level, when populations are judged to be potentially taxonomically distinct on the basis of genetic data or morphological observations. In contrast, IUCN and BirdLife International bird threat rankings are assigned only at species level. This paper represents the first time that the entire modern New Zealand avifauna has been assessed from a conservation perspective. A brief analysis of patterns of extinction, threat, and rarity exhibited by the taxa listed is presented.},

@article{Chang2017,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although numerous prestigious medical organizations have called for its abolishment, participation in the sport of boxing has reached an all-time high among both men and women, and its elimination is unlikely in the near future. Physicians should strive to increase boxing safety by improving the rules of competition, which have evolved minimally over the past two centuries. Currently, subjective criteria are used to determine whether or not a contest should be halted. Developing a standardized, objective method of determining when a contest should be halted would be a significant paradigm shift and could increase the safety of the sport's participants. This study analyzed the number and types of punches landed in a typical professional match, in bouts considered to be competitive and in those that ended in fatalities, to determine whether or not this would be a practical method of differentiating between these groups. METHODS: Three groups of professional boxing matches were defined at the beginning of the study: 1) a "fatal" group, consisting of bouts that resulted in the death of a participant; 2) a "classic" group that represented competitive matches; and 3) a "control" group of 4000 professional boxing matches representing the average bout. A computer program known as Punchstat (Compubox, Inc., Manorville, NY) was used in the objective analysis of these matches via videotape playback. RESULTS: Several statistically significant differences were discovered between matches that resulted in fatalities and the control group. These include the number of punches landed per round, the number of power punches landed per round, and the number of power punches thrown per round by losing boxers. However, when the fatal bouts were compared with the most competitive bouts, these differences were no longer evident. CONCLUSION: Based on the data analyzed between the control and fatal-bout groups, a computerized method of counting landed blows at ringside could provide sufficient data to stop matches that might result in fatalities. However, such a process would become less effective as matches become more competitive, and implementing such a change would significantly decrease the competitive nature of the sport. Therefore, other methods of quantifying acceleration-deceleration brain injuries are necessary to improve the safety of boxing.},

abstract = {This chapter describes structural features and evolution of metazoan mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules. Throughout the evolution of metazoa, gene content of mitochondria-genomes is highly conserved, as has the close packing of genes. Most of the occasional sequence expansions that have occurred, by way of either repeated or noncoding unique sequences, are found in the control or putative control region, rather than being dispersed between genes. Of the 13 open reading frames recognized in the human mtDNA molecules, four (COI, COII, COIII, and Cyt b) are originally identified in regard to the proteins they encode, from similarities of their predicted amino acid sequences to known amino acid sequences of bovine proteins, and predicted amino acid sequences of yeast mt-protein genes. Among mtDNAs of vertebrates and higher invertebrates, there are genes that overlap. Some overlaps are among the 3′ ends of two genes that are encoded in opposite strands of the molecule. The extent of size reduction within metazoan mitochondrial-transfer RNA (mt-tRNA) gene sets strongly correlates with the degree to which the more variable secondary structure element-forming regions of mt-rRNA genes are lost. {\textcopyright} 1992 Academic Press Inc.},

abstract = {Cardiocondyla spp. are small, inconspicuous ants, native to the Old World. Until recently, Cardiocondyla mauritanica Forel, 1890 was a little known species recorded almost exclusively from the semi-arid subtropics of North Africa, the Middle East, and neighboring islands. In contrast, Cardiocondyla nuda Mayr, 1866 was considered a cosmopolitan tramp species, spread broadly around the world through human commerce. A recent taxonomic reanalysis by B. Seifert, however, found genuine C. nuda restricted to Australia, New Guinea, and Western Oceania, and that published records of ‘C. nuda' from outside this region were based on misidentifications of other species, notably C. mauritanica. In addition, Cardiocondyla ectopia, known from North America, was found to be a junior synonym of C. mauritanica. Here, I examine the worldwide spread of C. mauritanica. I compiled published and unpublished C. mauritanica specimen records from {\textgreater}250 sites, documenting the earliest known records for 47 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major islands, and US states), including sev- eral for which I found no previously published records: Barbados, Bonaire, Cura{\c{c}}ao, Grenada, Saba, and Saudi Arabia. Cardiocondyla mauritanica is found primarily in semi-arid and urban environments. Cardiocondyla mauritanica shows an apparently continuous distribution and geographic variation in morphology from northwest Africa to India suggesting that C. mauritanica is native throughout this subtropical expanse. Old World records of C. mauritanica far from this range come from Ascension, Zimbabwe, and several Indo-Pacific islands. Te sole temperate record of C. mauritanica comes from Ukraine. Cardiocondyla mauritanica was first found in the New World in 1967, and has spread through the southwestern US, northern Mexico, Florida, and the West Indies. Part of the success of C. mauritanica in exotic locales may relate to its ability to co-exist with dominant invasive ants, such as the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr, 1868).},

@article{Xia2005,
abstract = {The H-strand of vertebrate mitochondrial DNA is left single-stranded for hours during the slow DNA replication. This facilitates C→U mutations on the H-strand (and consequently G→A mutations on the L-strand) via spontaneous deamination which occurs much more frequently on single-stranded than on double-stranded DNA. For the 12 coding sequences (CDS) collinear with the L-strand, NNY synonymous codon families (where N stands for any of the four nucleotides and Y stands for either C or U) end mostly with C, and NNR and NNN codon families (where R stands for either A or G) end mostly with A. For the lone ND6 gene on the other strand, the codon bias is the opposite, with NNY codon families ending mostly with U and NNR and NNN codon families ending mostly with G. These patterns are consistent with the strand-specific mutation bias. The codon usage biased towards C-ending and A-ending in the 12 CDS sequences affects the codon-anticodon adaptation. The wobble site of the anticodon is always G for NNY codon families dominated by C-ending codons and U for NNR and NNN codon families dominated by A-ending codons. The only, but consistent, exception is the anticodon of tRNA-Met which consistently has a 5′-CAU-3′ anticodon base-pairing with the AUG codon (the translation initiation codon) instead of the more frequent AUA. The observed CAU anticodon (matching AUG) would increase the rate of translation initiation but would reduce the rate of peptide elongation because most methionine codons are AUA, whereas the unobserved UAU anticodon (matching AUA) would increase the elongation rate at the cost of translation initiation rate. The consistent CAU anticodon in tRNA-Met suggests the importance of maximizing the rate of translation initiation. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

While recent molecular studies have provided some insights into their evolutionary history, sister group relationships remain mostly unresolved, particularly at mid-taxonomic levels. Specifically, within Hydroidolina, the most speciose hydrozoan subclass, the relationships and sometimes integrity of orders are highly unsettled. Here we obtained the near complete mitochondrial sequence of twenty-six hydroidolinan hydrozoan species from a range of sources (DNA and RNA-seq data, long-range PCR). Our analyses confirm previous inference of the evolution of mtDNA in Hydrozoa while introducing a novel genome organization. Using RNA-seq data, we propose a mechanism for the expression of mitochondrial mRNA in Hydroidolina that can be extrapolated to the other medusozoan taxa. Phylogenetic analyses using the full set of mitochondrial gene sequences provide some insights into the order-level relationships within Hydroidolina, including siphonophores as the first diverging clade, a well-supported clade comprised of Leptothecata-Filifera III–IV, and a second clade comprised of Aplanulata-Capitata {\textless}italic{\textgreater}s.s.{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-Filifera I–II.

abstract = {The reconstruction of evolutionary trees from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data is a common tool with which to infer the relationships of living organisms. The wide use of mtDNA stems from the ease of getting new sequence data for a set of orthologus genes and from the availability of many existing mtDNA sequences for a wide array of species. In this review we argue that developing a fuller understanding of the biology of mitochondria is essential for the rigorous application of mtDNA to inferences about the evolutionary history of species or populations. Though much progress has been made in understanding the parameters that shape the evolution of mitochondria and mtDNA, many questions still remain, and a better understanding of the role this organelle plays in regulating organismal fitness is becoming increasingly critical for accurate phylogeny reconstruction. In population biology, the limited information content of one nonrecombining genetic marker can compromise evolutionary inference, and the effects of nuclear genetic variation—and environmental factors—in mtDNA fitness differences can compound these problems. In systematics, the limited gene set, biased amino acid composition, and problems of compensatory substitutions can cloud phylogenetic signal. Dissecting the functional bases of these biases offers both challenges and opportunities in comparative biology.},

abstract = {Mountain ranges, deserts, ice fields and oceans generally act as barriers to the movement of land-dependent animals, often profoundly shaping migration routes. We used satellite telemetry to track the southward flights of bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica baueri), shorebirds whose breeding and non-breeding areas are separated by the vast central Pacific Ocean. Seven females with surgically implanted transmitters flew non-stop 8,117-11,680 km (10153+/-1043 s.d.) directly across the Pacific Ocean; two males with external transmitters flew non-stop along the same corridor for 7,008-7,390 km. Flight duration ranged from 6.0 to 9.4 days (7.8+/-1.3 s.d.) for birds with implants and 5.0 to 6.6 days for birds with externally attached transmitters. These extraordinary non-stop flights establish new extremes for avian flight performance, have profound implications for understanding the physiological capabilities of vertebrates and how birds navigate, and challenge current physiological paradigms on topics such as sleep, dehydration and phenotypic flexibility. Predicted changes in climatic systems may affect survival rates if weather conditions at their departure hub or along the migration corridor should change. We propose that this transoceanic route may function as an ecological corridor rather than a barrier, providing a wind-assisted passage relatively free of pathogens and predators.},

abstract = {The stigma ant, Pachycondyla stigma (FABRICIUS, 1804), is an inconspicuous forest species that generally nests in and under rotten logs and feeds on termites. This species has an extensive range in both the New World and Old World tropics, but there has been disagreement on where P. stigma is native. To evaluate its known distribution and consider hypo- theses on its native range, I compiled and mapped records of P. stigma from {\textgreater} 600 sites. I documented the earliest known P. stigma records for 55 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major West Indian islands, and US states) including several for which I found no previously published records: Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Lucia, and Tonga. Pachycondyla stigma shows characteristics of a native species throughout its range in both the New World and Old World, with near continuous distributions in intact forest habitats. The earliest records of P. stigma come primarily from the Neotropics; before 1900, there were published Neotropical records from Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Panama, St Vincent, and Cuba, but only one published record from the Old World (Aru Island, Indonesia). Although P. stigma has relatives in both the Neotropics and Australia, its closest known relative is from Central America. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that P. stigma originated in tropical South and Central America. Genetic analyses are needed to determine whether the native range of P. stigma also includes the West Indies and Florida},

abstract = {1. Ants are ubiquitous ecosystem engineers and generalist predators and are able to affect ecological communities via both pathways. They are likely to influence any other terrestrial arthropod group either directly or indirectly caused by their high abundance and territoriality. 2. We studied the impact of two ant species common in Central Europe, Myrmica rubra and Lasius niger, on an arthropod community. Colony presence and density of these two ant species were manipulated in a field experiment from the start of ant activity in spring to late summer. 3. The experiment revealed a positive influence of the presence of one ant colony on densities of decomposers, herbivores and parasitoids. However, in the case of herbivores and parasitoids, this effect was reversed in the presence of two colonies. 4. Generally, effects of the two ant species were similar with the exception of their effect on Braconidae parasitoid densities that responded positively to one colony of M. rubra but not of L. niger. 5. Spider density was not affected by ant colony manipulation, but species richness of spiders responded positively to ant presence. This effect was independent of ant colony density, but where two colonies were present, spider richness was significantly greater in plots with two M. rubra colonies than in plots with one colony of each ant species. 6. To test whether the positive ecosystem engineering effects were purely caused by modified properties of the soil, we added in an additional experiment (i) the soil from ant nests (without ants) or (ii) unmodified soil or (iii) ant nests (including ants) to experimental plots. Ant nest soil on its own did not have a significant impact on densities of decomposers, herbivores or predators, which were significantly, and positively, affected by the addition of an intact nest. 7. The results suggest an important role of both ant species in the grassland food web, strongly affecting the densities of decomposers, herbivores and higher trophic levels. We discuss how the relative impact via bottom-up and top-down effects of ants depends on nest density, with a relatively greater top-down predatory impact at higher densities.},

Without its control region, it has a total length of 15,485 bp, consisting of 37 genes: 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. Except for eight tRNAs and the nd6 gene, all other mitochondrial genes are encoded on the heavy strand. ATG and ATC act mainly as the initial codon in 10 protein-coding genes, whereas nd2 and cox1 use ATT and nad3 uses ATA. Gene order is generally consistent with that observed in closely-related families. The cloverleaf structures for trnS1 and trnC lacked the DHU-stem and DHU-loop, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of mitogenomes of closely-related families indicate that Brachycephalidae is more closely-related to Craugastoridae than to Eleutherodactylidae. This is the first sequenced mitochondrial genome for the entire Brachycephalidae and can provide the basis for the development of mitochondrial markers for other members of the family, including many species that are critically endangered.},

Between 1994 and 2010, a total of 450 km2 of offshore area, including 218 km 2 of intertidal flats (one third of the original tidal area in the bay), has been reclaimed along the bay for two industrial projects. This has caused the northward migrants to become concentrated in an ever smaller remaining area, our core study site. The spring peak numbers of two Red Knot subspecies in the East Asia-Australasian Flyway, Calidris canutus piersmai and C. c. rogersi, in this so far little affected area increased from 13{\%} in 2007 to 62{\%} in 2010 of the global populations; the spring peak numbers of Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea increased from 3{\%} in 2007 to 23{\%} in 2010 of the flyway population. The decline in the extent of intertidal mudflats also affected Relict Gulls Larus relictus, listed by IUCN as "Vulnerable"; during normal winters 56{\%} of the global population moved from the wintering habitats that were removed in Tianjin to the relatively intact areas around Tangshan. Densities of wintering Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, and spring-staging Broad-billed Sandpiper Limicola falcinellus and Sanderling Calidris alba have also increased in the remaining areas. With the proposed continuation of land reclamation in Bohai Bay, we predict waterbird densities in the remaining areas to increase to a point of collapse. To evaluate the future of these fragile, shared international resources, it is vital to promote an immediate conservation action plan for the remaining coastal wetlands in this region, and continued population monitoring to determine the effects of this action.

Here, we consider the alternative method of analyzing all character data simultaneously. Such 'supermatrix' analyses use information from each character directly and enable straightforward incorporation of diverse kinds of data, including characters from fossils. The approach has been extended by the development of new methods, including model-based techniques for analyzing heterogeneous data and hierarchical methods for constructing extremely large trees. Recent work also suggests that the problem of missing data in supermatrix analyses has been overstated. Although the supermatrix approach is not suited for all cases, we suggest that its inherent strengths will ensure that it will continue to have a central role in inferring large phylogenetic trees from diverse data. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, we review recent hypotheses about the origin of the nucleus. Model systems for the study of "endosymbiosis in action" are also described, and the hypothesis that symbiogenesis may contribute to the generation of new species is critically assessed with special reference to the secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis (macroevolution) of unicellular eukaryotic algae. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Damselflies and dragonflies, of the order Odonata, have distinct body plans and predatory abilities. Knowledge of their various evolutionary histories will allow for an understanding of the genetic and phenotypic evolution of insects. Mitogenomes are suitable materials to elucidate this, but the mitogenome of only a few odonates have been annotated. Herein, we report the complete mitogenome of nine odonates, including seven dragonflies and two damselflies, and a comprehensive analysis of the codon usage in 31 Odonata mitogenomes with the aim to estimate their evolutionary characteristics. Overall, a weak codon bias exists among odonate mitogenomes, although this favours AT-ending codons. Damselflies have a weaker codon usage bias than dragonflies, and 37 codons have significantly different usages. Both directional mutation and purifying selection shape damselfly and dragonfly mitogenomes. Although inevitable, directional mutation bias plays a minor role, whereas purifying selection pressure is the dominant evolutionary force. A higher selection pressure is observed in dragonflies than in damselflies, but it mainly acts on codon usage patterns rather than amino acid translation. Our findings suggest that dragonflies might have more efficient mitochondrial gene expression levels than damselflies, producing more proteins that support their locomotion and predatory abilities.},

I documented the earliest known W. auropunctata records for 53 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major West Indian islands, and US states), including many with no previously published records: Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Caicos Islands, El Salvador, Guam, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Martin, and Texas. In the New World, W. auropunctata has a seemingly continuous distribution from central Argentina to southernmost Texas, suggesting that it may be native throughout this expanse. Wasmannia auropunctata has also spread throughout the West Indies and to peninsular Florida, though it is unclear which West Indian islands may constitute part of its native range. The earliest Old World reports of W. auropunctata, in the 1890's, came from West Africa: Sierra Leone and Gabon. Although no additional records have come from Sierra Leone, W. auropunctata has spread broadly across Gabon and into neighboring countries, where it is a serious pest. In Oceania, the earliest records of W. auropunctata date to 1972 from New Caledonia and 1974 from the Solomon Islands. Pacific populations of W. auropunctata are actively spread- ing within these islands and to many other island groups. In the past decade, first records of W. auropunc- tata have been reported from several Old World areas, including the Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Guam, Italy, and Israel.

Here we show that besides providing abundant genomic data, UCE sequencing is an excellent source of both sequences for microsatellite loci design and complete mitochondrial genomes with high sequencing depth. Identification of dozens of microsatellite loci and assembly of complete mitogenomes is exemplified here using three species of Poospiza warbling finches from southern and southeastern Brazil.

Spermateleosis and sperm morphology of two species of caecilians, Ichthyophis tricolor and Uraeotyphlus cf. narayani, from the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, were studied using light and transmission electron microscopy. Spermateleosis is described in early, mid-, and late phases. During the early phase, the spermatid nucleus does not elongate, but the acrosome vesicle is Golgi-derived and its material is produced as a homogeneous substance rather than as discrete granules. In development of the acrosome, the centrioles shift in position to the lower half of the cell. The acrosomal vesicles take the full shape of the acrosome with the establishment of the perforatorium in midphase. An endonuclear canal develops and accommodates the perforatorium. The incipient flagellum is laid down when the proximal centriole attaches to the posterior side of the nucleus and the distal centriole connects to the proximal centriole, which forms the basal granule of the acrosome. The axial fiber also appears during midphase. The mitochondria shift in position to the posterior pole of the cell to commence establishment of the midphase. Late phase is characterized by nuclear condensation and elongation. Consequently, the final organization of the sperm is established with the head containing the nucleus and the acrosome. The undulating membrane separates the axoneme and axial fiber. Most of the cytoplasm is lost as residual bodies. J. Morphol. 262:484499, 2004. 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Unequal usage of synonymous codons in the gene transcript for an amino acid is known as codon usage bias (CUB). It is a unique property of gene as well as genome. Mutation and natural selection are known to be the major factors that influence CUB. Other factors encompass gene expression level, GC content, codon position, recombination rate, RNA stability and gene length. CUB analysis helps in in-depth understanding of the molecular biology, genetics and genome evolution in a species. We used bioinformatic methods to explore the pattern of CUB in MT-ATP6 gene in different classes of platyhelminthes. The analysis is based on genetic code of translational table 14 of National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) where the codon AAA codes for asparagine and TAA for tyrosine amino acid. The synonymous codon usage order (SCUO), an index of CUB, values in different classes namely cestoda, monogenea, rabditophora, trematoda and turbellaria of platyhelminths were found to be 0.43, 0.32, 0.49, 0.40 and 0.36, respectively which suggest that the codon usage bias of ATP6 gene was low (SCUO {\textless} 0.50). Highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) was found between SCUO and various GC contents indicating that GC composition had an influence on CUB. From the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis on codons, we found most of the over-represented codons in all the classes were A/T ending types, which suggested that the preferred codons were influenced by compositional constraints. The PR2 plot revealed asymmetric usage of AT and GC bases among the four fold degenerate codon families with greater usage of G and T over A and C. Highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) was found between overall nucleotide composition and its 3rd codon position suggesting that both natural selection and mutation pressure might have influenced the CUB among different classes. Neutrality analysis revealed that natural selection might play a major role. Mutational responsive index (MRI) and translational selection (P2) values elucidated that selection for translational efficiency moderately affected the codon usage bias in MT-ATP6 gene.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Exertional rhabdomyolysis can occur in individuals performing various types of exercise but it is unclear why some individuals develop this condition while others do not. Previous investigations have determined the role of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to explain inter-individual variability of serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations after exertional muscle damage. However, there has been no research about the interrelationship among these SNPs. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze seven SNPs that are candidates for explaining individual variations of CK response after a marathon competition (ACE = 287bp Ins/Del, ACTN3 = p.R577X, CKMM = NcoI, IGF2 = C13790G, IL6 = 174G{\textgreater}C, MLCK = C37885A, TNF$\alpha$ = 308G{\textgreater}A). METHODS Using Williams and Folland's model, we determined the total genotype score from the accumulated combination of these seven SNPs for marathoners with a low CK response (n = 36; serum CK {\textless}400 U{\textperiodcentered}L-1) vs. marathoners with a high CK response (n = 31; serum CK ≥400 U{\textperiodcentered}L-1). RESULTS At the end of the race, low CK responders had lower serum CK (290±65 vs. 733±405 U{\textperiodcentered}L-1; P{\textless}0.01) and myoglobin concentrations (443±328 vs. 1009±971 ng{\textperiodcentered}mL-1, P{\textless}0.01) than high CK responders. Although the groups were similar in age, anthropometric characteristics, running experience and training habits, total genotype score was higher in low CK responders than in high CK responders (5.2±1.4 vs. 4.4±1.7 point, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION Marathoners with a lower CK response after the race had a more favorable polygenic profile than runners with high serum CK concentrations. This might suggest a significant role of genetic polymorphisms in the levels of exertional muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis. Yet other SNPs, in addition to exercise training, might also play a role in the values of CK after damaging exercise.},

At the confluence of a multitude of social, religious, political, and scientific factors lies the biology teacher. This phenomenological study provides insight into the salient aspects of teaching evolution as viewed by public high school biology teachers. Transcribed interviews were coded, and data were sorted resulting in key themes regarding teachers' views of evolution education. These themes are presented against the backdrop of extant literature on the teaching and learning of evolution.

O trabalho em quest{\~{a}}o avalia qualitativamente as opini{\~{o}}es e experi{\^{e}}ncias de professores de biologia do ensino m{\'{e}}dio ao ensinar evolu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o.
Foram entrevistados 6 professores de 2 estados nos quais o ensino de evolu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} obrigat{\'{o}}rio. Os dados foram analisados utilizando a metodologia "open coding", que fragmenta os dados e os identifica em categorias para encontrar padr{\~{o}}es neles.

abstract = {Because they house large biodiversity collections and are also research centres with sequencing facilities, natural history museums are well placed to develop DNA barcoding best practices. The main difficulty is generally the vouchering system: it must ensure that all data produced remain attached to the corresponding specimen, from the field to publication in articles and online databases. The Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris is one of the leading laboratories in the Marine Barcode of Life (MarBOL) project, which was used as a pilot programme to include barcode collections for marine molluscs and crustaceans. The system is based on two relational databases. The first one classically records the data (locality and identification) attached to the specimens. In the second one, tissue-clippings, DNA extractions (both preserved in 2D barcode tubes) and PCR data (including primers) are linked to the corresponding specimen. All the steps of the process [sampling event, specimen identification, molecular processing, data submission to Barcode Of Life Database (BOLD) and GenBank] are thus linked together. Furthermore, we have developed several web-based tools to automatically upload data into the system, control the quality of the sequences produced and facilitate the submission to online databases. This work is the result of a joint effort from several teams in the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN), but also from a collaborative network of taxonomists and molecular systematists outside the museum, resulting in the vouchering so far of ∼41,000 sequences and the production of ∼11,000 COI sequences.},

abstract = {Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been successfully used in phylogenomics for a variety of taxa, but their power in phylogenetic inference has yet to be extensively compared with that of traditional Sanger sequencing data sets. Moreover, UCE data on invertebrates, including insects, are sparse. We compared the phylogenetic informativeness of 959 UCE loci with a multi-locus data set of ten nuclear markers obtained via Sanger sequencing, testing the ability of these two types of data to resolve and date the evolutionary history of the second most species-rich subfamily of ants in the world, the Formicinae. Phylogenetic analyses show that UCEs are superior in resolving ancient and shallow relationships in formicine ants, demonstrated by increased node support and a more resolved phylogeny. Phylogenetic informativeness metrics indicate a twofold improvement relative to the 10-gene data matrix generated from the identical set of taxa. We were able to significantly improve formicine classification based on our comprehensive UCE phylogeny. Our divergence age estimations, using both UCE and Sanger data, indicate that crown-group Formicinae are older (104–117 Ma) than previously suggested. Biogeographic analyses infer that the diversification of the subfamily has occurred on all continents with no particular hub of cladogenesis. We found UCEs to be far superior to the multi-locus data set in estimating formicine relationships. The early history of the clade remains uncertain due to ancient rapid divergence events that are unresolvable even with our genomic-scale data, although this might be largely an effect of several problematic taxa subtended by long branches. Our comparison of divergence ages from both Sanger and UCE data demonstrates the effectiveness of UCEs for dating analyses. This comparative study highlights both the promise and limitations of UCEs for insect phylogenomics, and will prove useful to the growing number of evolutionary biologists considering the transition from Sanger to next-generation sequencing approaches.},

This ant is also common in villages and cities, where it is well known for its powerful sting that sometimes leads to anaphylactic shock in humans {\&} even death. Recent first reports of P. sennaarensis from subtropical parts of the Arabian Peninsula {\&} Iran have led many researchers to conclude that populations of this ant are expanding. To evaluate this possibility, I compiled {\&} mapped specimen records of P. sennaarensis from more-than 300 sites. I documented the earliest known P. sennaarensis records for 40 countries, including several for which I found no previously published records: Bahrain, Chad, India, Liberia, Mozambique, {\&} Zambia. In 1925, when most of the world's ant fauna was still poorly documented, P. sennaarensis had already been collected from widely scattered locales in 26 countries across tropical Africa {\&} Arabia. In addition, there is a single isolated 1896 record of P. sennaarensis from an apparently temporary population in tropical India. All P. sennaarensis records from subtropical sites north of 23.4-degrees-N (in Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, {\&} Saudi Arabia) are from after 1950, except one record from just outside the tropics (Muscat, Oman; 23.6-degrees-N). It is possible that P. sennaarensis populations have lived in these subtropical areas for a long time, but are only now being reported, perhaps due to a recent population increase of this species. In fact, although the earliest specimen record from Iran dates to 2001, older residents of SE Iran remember the sting of P. sennaarensis from their childhood. Still, it is possible that P. sennaarensis has really expanded its geographic range northeastward into new regions during the past few decades.]},

For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can occur in scholarly authorship.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are generally thought to occur after human aided migration to a new range. However, human activities prior to migration may also play a role. We studied here the evolutionary genetics of introduced populations of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata at a worldwide scale. Using microsatellite markers, we reconstructed the main routes of introduction of the species. We found three main routes of introduction, each of them strongly associated to human history and trading routes. We also demonstrate the overwhelming occurrence of male and female clonality in introduced populations of W. auropunctata, and suggest that this particular reproduction system is under selection in human-modified habitats. Together with previous researches focused on native populations, our results suggest that invasive clonal populations may have evolved within human modified habitats in the native range, and spread further from there. The evolutionarily most parsimonious scenario for the emergence of invasive populations of the little fire ant might thus be a two-step process. The W. auropunctata case illustrates the central role of humans in biological change, not only due to changes in migration patterns, but also in selective pressures over species.},

The most conserved gene order is found in placental mammals, turtles, fishes, some lizards and Xenopus. Birds, other species of lizards, crocodilians, marsupial mammals, snakes, tuatara, lamprey, and some other amphibians and one species of fish have gene orders that are less conserved. The most probable mechanism for new gene rearrangements seems to be tandem duplication and multiple deletion events, always associated with tRNA sequences. Some new rearrangements seem to be typical of monophyletic groups and the use of data from these groups may be useful for answering phylogenetic questions involving vertebrate higher taxonomic levels. Other features such as the secondary structure of tRNA, and the start and stop codons of protein-coding genes may also be useful in comparisons of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes.},

We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98{\%} of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99{\%}, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30{\%} of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with Nin-Cin topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for Nout-Cin topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

Episodes of geographic expansion and colonisation linked Eurasia and North America across Beringia and drove macroevolutionary structure of host and parasite associations. Asynchronous dispersal from centres of origin in Eurasia into the Nearctic resulted in gradients in parasite diversity in the carnivoran, lagomorph, rodent and artiodactyl assemblages we reviewed. Recurrent faunal interchange and isolation in conjunction with episodes of host colonisation have produced a mosaic structure for parasite faunas and considerable cryptic diversity among nematodes and cestodes. Mechanisms of invasion and geographic colonisation leading to the establishment of complex faunal assemblages are equivalent in evolutionary and ecological time, as demonstrated by various explorations of diversity in these high-latitude systems. Our ability to determine historical responses to episodic shifts in global climate may provide a framework for predicting the cascading effects of contemporary environmental change. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, I compiled {\textgreater}700 site records of S. louisianae to document its biogeography. The known range of Strumigenys louisianae is largely continuous from Argentina to North Carolina (and possibly Virginia and Illinois) and on most major West Indian islands. The occurrence of S. louisianae throughout this region in a wide diversity of habitats makes it difficult to distinguish where it is native and where it has been introduced. The possibility remains that S. louisianae has a very broad native range, but no introduced populations. Alternatively, some isolated S. louisianae populations may be exotic, such as those on the Galapagos Islands, Cocos Island, many West Indian islands, and in Arizona. Genetic analyses are needed to determine where S. louisianae is native and where it is exotic.},

Three species (Odontoponera transversa, Pachycondyla indica, and Pachycondyla obscuricornis) contained a mixture of alkylpyrazines and oxygenated compounds and some simple terpenes; and the remaining two (Diacamma vagans and a Diacamma sp. from India) had only oxygenated compounds present. The two Diacamma species were notable in containing a dioxaspiro-undecane (a spiroketal), not hitherto found in ants. All the 33 known mandibular gland analyses of workers of ponerine ant species have been brought together in order to seek some pattern in the type of glandular contents.

abstract = {We analyze the frequencies of synonymous codons in animal mitochondrial genomes, focusing particularly on mammals and fish. The frequencies of bases at fourfold-degenerate sites are found to be strongly influenced by context-dependent mutation, which causes correlations between pairs of neighbouring bases. There is a pattern of excess of certain dinucleotides and deficit of others that is consistent across large numbers of species, despite the wide variation of single nucleotide frequencies among species. In many bacteria, translational selection is an important influence on codon usage. In order to test whether translational selection also plays a role in mitochondria, we need to control for context dependent mutation. Selection for translational accuracy can be detected by comparison of codon usage in conserved and variable sites in the same genes. We give a test of this type that works in the presence of context dependent mutation. There is very little evidence for translational accuracy selection in the mitochondrial genes considered here. Selection for translational efficiency might lead to preference for codons that match the limited repertoire of anticodons on the mitochondrial tRNAs. This is difficult to detect because the effect would usually be in the same direction in comparable codon families, and so would not cause an observable difference in codon usage between families. Several lines of evidence suggest that this type of selection is weak in most cases. However, we found several cases where unusual bases occur at the wobble position of the tRNA, and in these cases, some evidence for selection on codon usage was found. We discuss the way that these unusual cases are associated with codon reassignments in the mitochondrial genetic code.},

abstract = {Research that connects the effects of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem services is lacking. Ants perform multifarious ecological functions that stabilize ecosystems and contribute to a number of ecosystem services. We studied responses of ant communities to urbanization in the Lake Tahoe basin by sampling sites along a gradient of urban land development. We sampled ant communities, measured vegetation characteristics, quantified human activities, and evaluated ant-community responses by grouping ants into service-providing units (SPUs), defined as a group of organisms and their populations that perform specific ecosystem services, to provide an understanding of urbanization impacts on biodiversity and their delivery of ecosystem services. Species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate levels of urban development, as did the richness of 3 types of ant SPUs (aerators, decomposers, and compilers). With increasing land development aerator and decomposer ants significantly declined in abundance, whereas compiler ants significantly increased in abundance. Competing models demonstrated that precipitation was frequently among the strongest influences on ant community structure; however, urban development and human activities also had a strong, negative influence on ants, appearing in most models with DeltaAIC(c) {\textless} 2 for species richness and abundance patterns of SPUs and generalists. Response diversity was observed within SPUs, which suggests that the corresponding ecosystem services were maintained until development reached 30-40{\%}. Our data provide evidence that ecosystem functions, such as water infiltration and soil productivity, may be diminished at sites subject to greater levels of urbanization and that conserving ant communities and the ecosystem services they provide could be an important target in land-use planning and conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Abstract: The rearing environment of farmed animals can affect their behaviour when handled, and therefore needs to be taken into account when selecting for traits such as docility. Therefore, 126 German Landrace and Pietrain×German Landrace pigs were reared in two different production environments (barren (n =47) or slightly enriched (n =79)), both corresponding to commercial conditions. The marginal enrichment included the provision of more toys, an additional feeder type, and a larger number of conspecifics, while space allowance per pig remained equal. Pigs' responses to (a) a novel arena test (NAT), (b) a novel object test (NOT), and (c) weighing, were compared, together with the number of skin lesions (an indicator of aggressiveness). While the differences in behaviour in the NAT were not significant (p {\textgreater}0.1), the differences in the other tests were significant. In the NOT enriched housed pigs contacted the novel object more frequently (p =0.0124) and showed a tendency for a greater total duration of manipulating the novel object (p =0.0641). Furthermore, the pigs housed in enriched environment were calmer at loading onto the scale (p =0.0008), but more agitated on the scale (p {\textless}0.0001). Barren housed pigs had more severe skin lesions (p =0.0074). Correlations between scores from the behaviour tests and the daily weight gain were not significant. However, correlations between the behaviour patterns measured in the tests revealed that pigs which showed more activity in the NAT and NOT were also more active in the other tests. Results indicate that marginal changes in the housing environment affect the behaviour of the pigs. Overall, the activity of barren housed animals seemed to be reduced, as revealed by the behaviour tests. Therefore, the housing environment must be taken into consideration carefully when evaluating the behaviour or indicator traits such as skin lesions for selection purposes in pigs. In addition, results of the present study have implications for animal welfare, showing that marginal enrichment of rearing environment leads to changes in behaviour that may partially be related to improved cognitive and/or physical development of the pigs.

abstract = {The present article presents an up-to-date account of the current media relations of scientists, based on a comprehensive analysis of relevant surveys. The evidence suggests that most scientists consider visibility in the media important and responding to journalists a professional duty--an attitude that is reinforced by universities and other science organizations. Scientific communities continue to regulate media contacts with their members by certain norms that compete with the motivating and regulating influences of public information departments. Most scientists assume a two-arena model with a gap between the arenas of internal scientific and public communication. They want to meet the public in the public arena, not in the arena of internal scientific communication. Despite obvious changes in science and in the media system, the orientations of scientists toward the media, as well as the patterns of interaction with journalists, have their roots in the early 1980s. Although there is more influence on public communication from the science organizations and more emphasis on strategic considerations today, the available data do not indicate abrupt changes in communication practices or in the relevant beliefs and attitudes of scientists in the past 30 y. Changes in the science-media interface may be expected from the ongoing structural transformation of the public communication system. However, as yet, there is little evidence of an erosion of the dominant orientation toward the public and public communication within the younger generation of scientists.},

abstract = {The availability of mitochondrial genome sequences is growing as a result of recent technological advances in molecular biology. In phylogenetic analyses, the complete mitogenome is increasingly becoming the marker of choice, usually providing better phylogenetic resolution and precision relative to traditional markers such as cytochrome b (CYTB) and the control region (CR). In some cases, the differences in phylogenetic estimates between mitogenomic and single-gene markers have yielded incongruent conclusions. By comparing phylogenetic estimates made from different genes, we identified the most informative mitochondrial regions and evaluated the minimum amount of data necessary to reproduce the same results as the mitogenome. We compared results among individual genes and the mitogenome for recently published complete mitogenome datasets of selected delphinids (Delphinidae) and killer whales (genus Orcinus). Using Bayesian phylogenetic methods, we investigated differences in estimation of topologies, divergence dates, and clock-like behavior among genes for both datasets. Although the most informative regions were not the same for each taxonomic group (COX1, CYTB, ND3 and ATP6 for Orcinus, and ND1, COX1 and ND4 for Delphinidae), in both cases they were equivalent to less than a quarter of the complete mitogenome. This suggests that gene information content can vary among groups, but can be adequately represented by a portion of the complete sequence. Although our results indicate that complete mitogenomes provide the highest phylogenetic resolution and most precise date estimates, a minimum amount of data can be selected using our approach when the complete sequence is unavailable. Studies based on single genes can benefit from the addition of a few more mitochondrial markers, producing topologies and date estimates similar to those obtained using the entire mitogenome.},

abstract = {Many remnants of tropical forests are surrounded by deforested areas dominated by successional vegetation. Although secondary dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents and ants may influence seed predation and seedling recruitment, very little is known about its importance in degraded forest ecosystems. We studied the effects of secondary dispersal on seed predation, germination and seedling recruitment of the primarily bird-dispersed tree Clusia trochiformis in a tropical montane forest in Bolivia. We carried out exclosure experiments that allowed or excluded access to seeds by vertebrates in three habitat types (forest interior, degraded habitat close to and degraded habitat far from the forest margin) in a spatial block design at six sites. We offered a total of 1440 seeds (both with and without an aril) and marked half of them with a thread to follow their fate after 48 h and after 1 month. We found that secondary dispersal by ants was highest in the forest interior but was also frequent in degraded habitats close to and far from the forest edge. Secondary dispersal significantly increased seedling recruitment, particularly in the degraded habitats, probably because seeds were often dispersed to sites beneath the leaf litter. Recruitment success increased significantly with dispersal distance. High recruitment of secondarily dispersed seeds in the degraded habitat was due to the combined effect of reduced predation and increased germination of seeds that had been moved by ants. Synthesis. In the absence of secondary dispersal, seed germination and seedling recruitment were very low in degraded habitats. Seed dispersal by ants substantially increased natural regeneration in the deforested habitats. Our experiments thus demonstrate that the effects of biotic interactions on plant demography can vary across habitat boundaries at small spatial scales and that secondary dispersal is a crucial and overlooked process that can aid the regeneration of deforested habitats in the tropics.

We demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in case studies using real NGS data sets of the two monogenean ectoparasites species Gyrodactylus thymalli and Gyrodactylus derjavinoides including their respective teleost hosts European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). MITObim appeared superior to existing tools in terms of accuracy, runtime and memory requirements and fully automatically recovered mitochondrial genomes exceeding 99.5{\%} accuracy from total genomic DNA derived NGS data sets in {\textless}24 h using a standard desktop computer. The approach overcomes the limitations of traditional strategies for obtaining mitochondrial genomes for species with little or no mitochondrial sequence information at hand and represents a fast and highly efficient in silico alternative to laborious conventional strategies relying on initial long-range PCR. We furthermore demonstrate the applicability of MITObim for metagenomic/pooled data sets using simulated data. MITObim is an easy to use tool even for biologists with modest bioinformatics experience.

abstract = {Essential amino acids (EAA) consist of a group of nine amino acids that animals are unable to synthesize via de novo pathways. Recently, it has been found that most metazoans lack the same set of enzymes responsible for the de novo EAA biosynthesis. Here we investigate the sequence conservation and evolution of all the metazoan remaining genes for EAA pathways. Initially, the set of all 49 enzymes responsible for the EAA de novo biosynthesis in yeast was retrieved. These enzymes were used as BLAST queries to search for similar sequences in a database containing 10 complete metazoan genomes. Eight enzymes typically attributed to EAA pathways were found to be ubiquitous in metazoan genomes, suggesting a conserved functional role. In this study, we address the question of how these genes evolved after losing their pathway partners. To do this, we compared metazoan genes with their fungal and plant orthologs. Using phylogenetic analysis with maximum likelihood, we found that acetolactate synthase (ALS) and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) diverged from the expected Tree of Life (ToL) relationships. High sequence conservation in the paraphyletic group Plant-Fungi was identified for these two genes using a newly developed Python algorithm. Selective pressure analysis of ALS and BHMT protein sequences showed higher non-synonymous mutation ratios in comparisons between metazoans/fungi and metazoans/plants, supporting the hypothesis that these two genes have undergone non-ToL evolution in animals.},

abstract = {Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the great success stories in the history of life on Earth. From their first appearance in the Early Cretaceous, ants have come to occupy keystone positions in virtually all major terrestrial habitats, and they are absent only from Antarctica and a few inhospitable or remote islands. Despite the interest ants have long generated, our understanding of their taxonomy, diversity, evolution and ecology is far from complete. It is estimated that only half of the world's ant species - currently numbering about 12,200 - have been described. AntWeb's [www.antweb.org] mission is to develop tools to accelerate the discovery and documentation of ant diversity, and ensure ant information is widely accessible across a broad community. As such, AntWeb is the world's largest online database of images, specimen records, and natural history information on ants. A standardized digitizing protocol has been set up for extant species, which optimizes the image acquisition of each specimen in dorsal, profile, and head views, as well as the wings and male genitalia when applicable. As of July 2012, AntWeb has approximately 84000 high quality images of 20000 specimens representing over 9010 extant species. But the picture would be incomplete without the fossils. Recently the world catalogue of the fossil ants was added, which comprises 661 valid extinct species each represented by a single or few specimens disseminated in various fossil collections throughout the world. Besides the difficulty to access some of them, the main limitation to digitizing fossil ants is their mode of preservation. From spectacularly preserved specimens entombed within amber and showing the finest details of cuticular sculpturing, to the often shadowy outlines hinting at a structure that seems just out of view provided by an imprint, fossil ants often cannot be imaged following all the standards of extant specimens, and instead require specific methods for high quality image acquisition.},

We describe the construction of a database of 16 mitochondrial gene orders from fungi and other eukaryotes by using complete or nearly complete genomic sequences; propose a measure of gene order rearrangement based on the minimal set of chromosomal inversions, transpositions, insertions, and deletions necessary to convert the order in one genome to that of the other; report on algorithm design and the development of the DERANGE software for the calculation of this measure; and present the results of analyzing the mitochondrial data with the aid of this tool.},

abstract = {Estrogen Receptor alpha and beta (ER-{\$}\alpha{\$} and -{\$}\beta{\$}) are members of the nuclear receptor family of transcriptional regulators with distinct roles in mediating estrogen dependent breast cancer cell growth and differentiation. Following activation by the hormone, these proteins undergo conformation changes and accumulate in the nucleus, where they bind to chromatin at regulatory sites as homo- and/or heterodimers and assemble in large multiprotein complexes. Although the two ERs share a conserved structure, they exert specific and distinct functional roles in normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells and other cell types. To investigate the molecular bases of such differences, we performed a comparative computational analysis of the nuclear interactomes of the two ER subtypes, exploiting two datasets of receptor interacting proteins identified in breast cancer cell nuclei by Tandem Affinity Purification for their ability to associate in vivo with ligand-activated ER-{\$}\alpha{\$} and/or ER-{\$}\beta{\$}. These datasets comprise 498 proteins, of which only 70 are common to both ERs, suggesting that differences in the nature of the two ER interactomes are likely to sustain the distinct roles of the two receptor subtypes. Functional characterization of the two interactomes and their topological analysis, considering node degree and closeness of the networks, confirmed this possibility. Indeed, clustering and network dissection highlighted the presence of distinct and ER subtype-specific subnetworks endowed with defined functions. Altogether, these data provide new insights on the protein-protein interaction networks controlled by ER-{\$}\alpha{\$} and -{\$}\beta{\$} that mediate their ability to transduce estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells.},

abstract = {The evolutionary history of invasive species within their native range may involve key processes that allow them to colonize new habitats. Therefore, phylogeographic studies of invasive species within their native ranges are useful to understand invasion biology in an evolutionary context. Here we integrated classical and Bayesian phylogeographic methods using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers with a paleodistribution modeling approach, to infer the phylogeographic history of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata across its native distribution in South America. We discuss our results in the context of the recent establishment of this mostly tropical species in the Mediterranean region. Our Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggests that the common ancestor of the two main clades of W. auropunctata occurred in central Brazil during the Pliocene. Clade A would have differentiated northward and clade B southward, followed by a secondary contact beginning about 380,000 years ago in central South America. There were differences in the most suitable habitats among clades when considering three distinct climatic periods, suggesting that genetic differentiation was accompanied by changes in niche requirements, clade A being a tropical lineage and clade B a subtropical and temperate lineage. Only clade B reached more southern latitudes, with a colder climate than that of northern South America. This is concordant with the adaptation of this originally tropical ant species to temperate climates prior to its successful establishment in the Mediterranean region. This study highlights the usefulness of exploring the evolutionary history of invasive species within their native ranges to better understand biological invasions.

GC/MS analysis also revealed the presence of an additional disubstituted alkylpyrazine which was identified as 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine. Headspace sampling of confined ants with SPME and Porapak Q followed by GC/MS analysis showed 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine as the major volatile released by W. auropunctata workers while 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine was only detected in trace amounts. In laboratory bioassays, W. auropunctata workers were attracted and arrested by both pyrazines, although the results were not always consistent. Synthetic pyrazines generally attracted as many W. auropunctata workers as were attracted to a single crushed ant. However, higher numbers of W. auropunctata were arrested by crushed ant treatments than by synthetic pyrazines in all bioassays but one.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial gene content is highly variable across extant eukaryotes. The number of mitochondrial protein genes varies from 3 to 67, while tRNA gene content varies from 0 to 27. Moreover, these numbers exclude the many diverse lineages of non-respiring eukaryotes that lack a mitochondrial genome yet still contain a mitochondrion, albeit one often highly derived in ultrastructure and metabolic function, such as the hydrogenosome. Diversity in tRNA gene content primarily reflects differential usage of imported tRNAs of nuclear origin. In the case of protein genes, most of this diversity reflects differential degrees of functional gene transfer to the nucleus, with more minor contributions resulting from gene loss from the cell as a consequence of either substitution via a functional nuclear homolog or the cell's dispensation of the function of the gene product. The tempo and pattern of mitochondrial gene loss is highly episodic, both across the broad sweep of eukaryotes and within such well-studied groups as angiosperms. All animals, some plants, and certain other groups of eukaryotes are mired in profound stases in mitochondrial gene content, whereas other lineages have experienced relatively frequent gene loss. Loss and transfer to the nucleus of ribosomal protein and succinate dehydrogenase genes has been especially frequent, sporadic, and episodic during angiosperm evolution. Potential mechanisms for activation of transferred genes have been inferred, and intermediate stages in the process have been identified by comparative studies. Several hypotheses have been proposed for why mitochondrial genes are transferred to the nucleus, why mitochondria retain genomes, and why functional gene transfer is almost exclusively unidirectional. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

In 1986, T. difficilis was first found in the New World, but until 2007 it was mis- identified as Technomyrmex albipes (SMITH, 1861). Here, I examine the worldwide spread of T. difficilis. I compiled Technomyrmex difficilis specimen records from {\textgreater} 200 sites, documenting the earliest known T. difficilis records for 33 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major islands, and US states), including several for which I found no previously published records: the Bahamas, Honduras, Jamaica, the Mascarene Islands, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Africa, and Washington DC. Almost all outdoor records of Technomyrmex difficilis are from tropical areas, extending into the subtropics only in Madagascar, South Africa, the southeastern US, and the Bahamas. In addition, there are several indoor records of T. dif- ficilis from greenhouses at zoos and botanical gardens in temperate parts of the US. Over the past few years, T. difficilis has become a dominant arboreal ant at numerous sites in Florida and the West Indies. Unfortunately, T. difficilis ap- pears to be able to invade intact forest habitats, where it can more readily impact native species. It is likely that in the coming years, T. difficilis will become increasingly more important as a pest in Florida and the West Indies.},

Sequences include pore-forming toxins, phospholipases, peptidases, neurotoxins (sodium and potassium channel modulators), cysteine-rich secretory proteins and defensins (antimicrobial peptides). Fewer than 4{\%} of the sequences in the library occurred across the three individuals examined, demonstrating high sequence variability of an individual's arsenal. We searched for actinoporins in Oulactis sp. to assess sequence similarity to the only described toxins (OR-A and -G) for this genus and examined the domain architecture of venom-related peptides and proteins. The novel putative actinoporin of Oulactis sp. has a greater similarity to other species in the Actiniidae family than to O. orientalis. Venom-related sequences have an architecture that occurs in single, repeat or multi-domain combinations of venom-related (e.g. ShK-like) and non-venom (e.g. whey acid protein) domains. This study has produced the first transcriptomes for an endemic Australian sea anemone species and the genus Oulactis, while identifying nearly 400 novel venom-related peptides and proteins for future structural and functional analyses and venom evolution studies.},

abstract = {The last 20 years witnessed a real paradigm shift concerning the impact of biotic factors on ecosystem functions as well as on vegetation structure of mangrove forests. Before this small scientific revolution took place, structural aspects of mangrove forests were viewed to be the result of abiotic processes acting from the bottom-up, while, at ecosystem level, the outwelling hypothesis stated that mangroves primary production was removed via tidal action and carried to adjacent nearshore ecosystems where it fuelled detrital based food-webs. The sesarmid crabs were the first macrofaunal taxon to be considered a main actor in mangrove structuring processes, thanks to a number of studies carried out in the Indo-Pacific forests in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following these classical papers, a number of studies on Sesarmidae feeding and burrowing ecology were carried out, which leave no doubts about the great importance of these herbivorous crabs in structuring and functioning Old world ecosystems. Although Sesarmidae are still considered very important in shaping mangrove structure and functioning, recent literature emphasizes the significance of other invertebrates. The Ocypodidae have now been shown to have the same role as Sesarmidae in terms of retention of forest products and organic matter processing in New world mangroves. In both New and Old world mangroves, crabs process large amounts of algal primary production, contribute consistently to retention of mangrove production and as ecosystem engineers, change particle size distribution and enhance soil aeration. Our understanding of the strong impact of gastropods, by means of high intake rates of mangrove products and differential consumption of propagules, has changed only recently. The role of insects must also be stressed. It is now clear that older techniques used to assess herbivory rates by insects strongly underestimate their impact, both in case of leaf eating and wood boring species and that herbivorous insects can potentially play a strong role in many aspects of mangrove ecology. Moreover, researchers only recently realized that ant-plant interactions may form an important contribution to our understanding of insect-plant dynamics in these habitats. Ants seem to be able to relieve mangroves from important herbivores such as many insects and sesarmid crabs. It thus seems likely that ants have positive effects on mangrove performance. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single gene in the last common ancestor of these species. Such genes have often retained identical biological roles in the present-day organisms. It is hence important to identify orthologs for transferring functional information between genes in different organisms with a high degree of reliability. For example, orthologs of human proteins are often functionally characterized in model organisms. Unfortunately, orthology analysis between human and e.g. invertebrates is often complex because of large numbers of paralogs within protein families. Paralogs that predate the species split, which we call out-paralogs, can easily be confused with true orthologs. Paralogs that arose after the species split, which we call in-paralogs, however, are bona fide orthologs by definition. Orthologs and in-paralogs are typically detected with phylogenetic methods, but these are slow and difficult to automate. Automatic clustering methods based on two-way best genome-wide matches on the other hand, have so far not separated in-paralogs from out-paralogs effectively. We present a fully automatic method for finding orthologs and inparalogs from two species. Ortholog clusters are seeded with a two-way best pairwise match, after which an algorithm for adding in-paralogs is applied. The method bypasses multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees, which can be slow and error-prone steps in classical ortholog detection. Still, it robustly detects complex orthologous relationships and assigns confidence values for both orthologs and in-paralogs. The program, called INPARANOID, was tested on all completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. To assess the quality of INPARANOID results, ortholog clusters were generated from a dataset of worm and mammalian transmembrane proteins, and were compared to clusters derived by manual tree-based ortholog detection methods. This study led to the identification with a high degree of confidence of over a dozen novel worm-mammalian ortholog assignments that were previously undetected because of shortcomings of phylogenetic methods. A WWW server that allows searching for orthologs between human and several fully sequenced genomes is installed at http://www.cgb.ki.se/inparanoid/. This is the first comprehensive resource with orthologs of all fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Programs and tables of orthology assignments are available from the same location. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The therapeutic properties of plants have been recognised since time immemorial. Many pathological conditions have been treated using plant-derived medicines. These medicines are used as concoctions or concentrated plant extracts without isolation of active compounds. Modern medicine however, requires the isolation and purification of one or two active compounds. There are however a lot of global health challenges with diseases such as cancer, degenerative diseases, HIV/AIDS and diabetes, of which modern medicine is struggling to provide cures. Many times the isolation of {\&}ldquo;active compound{\&}rdquo; has made the compound ineffective. Drug discovery is a multidimensional problem requiring several parameters of both natural and synthetic compounds such as safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy to be evaluated during drug candidate selection. The advent of latest technologies that enhance drug design hypotheses such as Artificial Intelligence, the use of {\&}lsquo;organ-on chip{\&}rsquo; and microfluidics technologies, means that automation has become part of drug discovery. This has resulted in increased speed in drug discovery and evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of candidate compounds whilst allowing novel ways of drug design and synthesis based on natural compounds. Recent advances in analytical and computational techniques have opened new avenues to process complex natural products and to use their structures to derive new and innovative drugs. Indeed, we are in the era of computational molecular design, as applied to natural products. Predictive computational softwares have contributed to the discovery of molecular targets of natural products and their derivatives. In future the use of quantum computing, computational softwares and databases in modelling molecular interactions and predicting features and parameters needed for drug development, such as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics, will result in few false positive leads in drug development. This review discusses plant-based natural product drug discovery and how innovative technologies play a role in next-generation drug discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many scientific disciplines rely on correct taxon delineations and identifications. So does a great part of the general public as well as decision makers. Researchers, students and enthusiastic amateurs often feel frustrated because information about species remains scattered, difficult to access, or difficult to decipher. Together, this affects almost anyone who wishes to identify species or verify identifications. Many remedies have been proposed, but we argue that the role of natural history collections remains insufficiently appreciated. We suggest using state-of-the-art mass imaging technology and to join forces to create a global natural history metacollection on the internet, providing access to the morphology of tens of millions of specimens and making them available for automated digital image analysis.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nDISCUSSION: Robotic high-resolution imaging technology and fast (high performance) computer-based image stitching make it now feasible to digitize entire collection drawers typically used for arthropod collections, or trays or containers used for other objects. Resolutions of 500 megapixels and much higher are already utilized to capture the contents of 40x50 cm collection drawers, providing amazing detail of specimens. Flanked by metadata entry, this helps to create access to tens of thousands of specimens in days. By setting priorities and combining the holdings of the most comprehensive collections for certain taxa, drawer digitizing offers the unique opportunity to create a global, virtual metacollection.The taxonomic and geographic coverage of such a collection could never be achieved by a single institution or individual. We argue that by joining forces, many new impulses will emerge for systematic biology, related fields and understanding of biodiversity in general.Digitizing drawers containing unidentified, little-curated specimens is a contribution towards the beginning of a new era of online curation. It also will help taxonomists and curators to discover and process the millions of "gems" of undescribed species hidden in museum accessions.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nSUMMARY: Our proposal suggests creating virtual, high-resolution image resources that will, for the first time in history, provide access for expert scientists as well as students and the general public to the enormous wealth of the world's natural history collections. We foresee that this will contribute to a better understanding, appreciation and increased use of biodiversity resources and the natural history collections serving this cause.},

Hymenoptera and Psocodea have greatly elevated rates of rearrangement offering both opportunities and pitfalls for identifying rearrangement synapomorphies in each group.

abstract = {The integrity of mitochondrial function is fundamental to cell life. It follows that disturbances of mitochondrial function will lead to disruption of cell function, expressed as disease or even death. In this review, I consider recent developments in our knowledge of basic aspects of mitochondrial biology as an essential step in developing our understanding of the contributions of mitochondria to disease. The identification of novel mechanisms that govern mitochondrial biogenesis and replication, and the delicately poised signalling pathways that coordinate the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are discussed. As fluorescence imaging has made the study of mitochondrial function within cells accessible, the application of that technology to the exploration of mitochondrial bioenergetics is reviewed. Mitochondrial calcium uptake plays a major role in influencing cell signalling and in the regulation of mitochondrial function, while excessive mitochondrial calcium accumulation has been extensively implicated in disease. Mitochondria are major producers of free radical species, possibly also of nitric oxide, and are also major targets of oxidative damage. Mechanisms of mitochondrial radical generation, targets of oxidative injury and the potential role of uncoupling proteins as regulators of radical generation are discussed. The role of mitochondria in apoptotic and necrotic cell death is seminal and is briefly reviewed. This background leads to a discussion of ways in which these processes combine to cause illness in the neurodegenerative diseases and in cardiac reperfusion injury. The demands of mitochondria and their complex integration into cell biology extends far beyond the provision of ATP, prompting a radical change in our perception of mitochondria and placing these organelles centre stage in many aspects of cell biology and medicine. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mitochondrial sequences have long been used to examine vertebrate phylogenetic relationships. The extensive use of mitochondrial data reflects the ease of obtaining mitochondrial sequences and its relatively rapid coalescence time. Mitochondrial genomes typically do not undergo recombination, so the entire mitogenome should have the same underlying gene tree. Thus, given appropriate analyses, conflict among estimates of phylogeny from different mitochondrial regions should not exist. However, estimates of phylogeny based upon different mitochondrial regions can exhibit incongruence. Conflict in phylogenetic signal among mitochondrial regions has been observed in galliform birds for the position of the Odontophoridae (New World quail). To explore this, we expanded sampling to 47 galliform mitogenomes, adding six new mitogenomes, which included representatives of two previously unsampled families. Analyses of complete mitogenomes recovered a well-supported topology that was congruent with expectations from multi-locus studies. However, when analyzing individual regions, we found conflicting positions for the Odontophoridae and several other relationships at multiple taxonomic levels. We tested multiple analytical strategies to reduce incongruence among regions, including partitioning by codon position, using mixture and codon-based models, RY coding, and excluding potentially misleading sites. No approach consistently reduced the conflict among mitochondrial regions at any taxonomic level. The biological attributes of both strongly misleading and non-misleading sites were essentially identical. Increasing taxa actually appeared to increase conflicting signal, even when taxa were selected to break up long branches. Collectively, our results indicate that analyzing mitochondrial data remains difficult, although analyzing complete mitogenomes resulted in a good estimate of the mitochondrial gene tree. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have greatly improved our ability to detect genomic variants for biomedical research. In particular, NGS technologies have been recently applied with great success to the discovery of mutations associated with the growth of various tumours and in rare Mendelian diseases. The advance in NGS technologies has also created significant challenges in bioinformatics. One of the major challenges is quality control of the sequencing data. In this review, we discuss the proper quality control procedures and parameters for Illumina technology-based human DNA re-sequencing at three different stages of sequencing: raw data, alignment and variant calling. Monitoring quality control metrics at each of the three stages of NGS data provides unique and independent evaluations of data quality from differing perspectives. Properly conducting quality control protocols at all three stages and correctly interpreting the quality control results are crucial to ensure a successful and meaningful study.},

abstract = {Native to the Neotropics, Wasmannia auropunctata has spread to numerous other tropical and subtropical areas, where it is can reach extremely high densities and threaten the local biota. To evaluate the worldwide spread of W. auropunctata, I compiled published and unpublished specimen records from {\textgreater} 1700 sites. I documented the earliest known W. auropunctata records for 53 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major West Indian islands, and US states), including many with no previously published records: Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Caicos Islands, El Salvador, Guam, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Martin, and Texas. In the New World, W. auropunctata has a seemingly continuous distribution from central Argentina to southernmost Texas, suggesting that it may be native throughout this expanse. Wasmannia auropunctata has also spread throughout the West Indies and to peninsular Florida, though it is unclear which West Indian islands may constitute part of its native range. The earliest Old World reports of W. auropunctata, in the 1890's, came from West Africa: Sierra Leone and Gabon. Although no additional records have come from Sierra Leone, W. auropunctata has spread broadly across Gabon and into neighboring countries, where it is a serious pest. In Oceania, the earliest records of W. auropunctata date to 1972 from New Caledonia and 1974 from the Solomon Islands. Pacific populations of W. auropunctata are actively spread- ing within these islands and to many other island groups. In the past decade, first records of W. auropunc- tata have been reported from several Old World areas, including the Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Guam, Italy, and Israel. Wasmannia auropunctata appears to still have much potential for future spread in the Old World.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

abstract = {The higher termites (Termitidae) are keystone species and ecosystem engineers. They have exceptional biomass and play important roles in decomposition of dead plant matter, in soil manipulation, and as the primary food for many animals, especially in the tropics. Higher termites are most diverse in rainforests, with estimated origins in the late Eocene (∼54 Ma), postdating the breakup of Pangaea and Gondwana when most continents became separated. Since termites are poor fliers, their origin and spread across the globe requires alternative explanation. Here, we show that higher termites originated 42-54 Ma in Africa and subsequently underwent at least 24 dispersal events between the continents in two main periods. Using phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genomes from 415 species, including all higher termite taxonomic and feeding groups, we inferred 10 dispersal events to South America and Asia 35-23 Ma, coinciding with the sharp decrease in global temperature, sea level, and rainforest cover in the Oligocene. After global temperatures increased, 23-5 Ma, there was only one more dispersal to South America but 11 to Asia and Australia, and one dispersal back to Africa. Most of these dispersal events were transoceanic and might have occurred via floating logs. The spread of higher termites across oceans was helped by the novel ecological opportunities brought about by environmental and ecosystem change, and led termites to become one of the few insect groups with specialized mammal predators. This has parallels with modern invasive species that have been able to thrive in human-impacted ecosystems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.In the horse, the term occipitoatlantoaxial malformation (OAAM) is used to describe a developmental defect in which the first cervical vertebra (atlas) resembles the base of the skull (occiput) and the second cervical vertebra (axis) resembles the atlas. Affected individuals demonstrate an abnormal posture and varying degrees of ataxia. The homeobox (HOX) gene cluster is involved in the development of both the axial and appendicular skeleton. Hoxd3-null mice demonstrate a strikingly similar phenotype to Arabian foals with OAAM. Whole-genome sequencing was performed in an OAAM-affected horse (OAAM1) and seven unaffected Arabian horses. Visual inspection of the raw reads within the region of HOXD3 identified a 2.7-kb deletion located 4.4 kb downstream of the end of HOXD4 and 8.2 kb upstream of the start of HOXD3. A genotyping assay revealed that both parents of OAAM1 were heterozygous for the deletion. Additional genotyping identified two of 162 heterozygote Arabians, and the deletion was not present in 371 horses of other breeds. Comparative genomics studies have revealed that this region is highly conserved across species and that the entire genomic region between Hoxd4 and Hoxd3 is transcribed in mice. Two additional Arabian foals diagnosed with OAAM (OAAM 2 and 3) were genotyped and did not have the 2.7-kb deletion. Closer examination of the phenotype in these cases revealed notable variation. OAAM3 also had facial malformations and a patent ductus arteriosus, and the actual malformation at the craniocervical junction differed. Genetic heterogeneity may exist across the HOXD locus in Arabian foals with OAAM.},

However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can occur in scholarly authorship.},

abstract = {In an era of biodiversity crisis, arthropods have great potential to inform conservation assessment and test hypotheses about community assembly. This is because their relatively narrow geographic distributions and high diversity offer high-resolution data on landscape-scale patterns of biodiversity. However, a major impediment to the more widespread application of arthropod data to a range of scientific and policy questions is the poor state of modern arthropod taxonomy, especially in the tropics. Inventories of spiders and other megadiverse arthropods from tropical forests are dominated by undescribed species. Such studies typically organize their data using morphospecies codes, which make it difficult for data from independent inventories to be compared and combined. To combat this shortcoming, we offer cyberdiversity, an online community-based approach for reconciling results of independent inventory studies where current taxonomic knowledge is incomplete. Participating scientists can upload images and DNA barcode sequences to dedicated databases and submit occurrence data and links to a web site (www.digitalSpiders.org). Taxonomic determinations can be shared with a crowdsourcing comments feature, and researchers can discover specimens of interest available for loan and request aliquots of genomic DNA extract. To demonstrate the value of the cyberdiversity framework, we reconcile data from three rapid structured inventories of spiders conducted in Vietnam with an independent inventory (Doi Inthanon, Thailand) using online image libraries. Species richness and inventory completeness were assessed using non-parametric estimators. Community similarity was evaluated using a novel index based on the Jaccard replacing observed with estimated values to correct for unobserved species. We use a distance-decay framework to demonstrate a rudimentary model of landscape-scale changes in community composition that will become increasingly informative as additional inventories participate. With broader adoption of the cyberdiversity approach, networks of information-sharing taxonomists can more efficiently and effectively address taxonomic impediments while elucidating landscape scale patterns of biodiversity.},

@article{Pyke2010,
abstract = {Housed worldwide, mostly in museums and herbaria, is a vast collection of biological specimens developed over centuries. These biological collections, and associated taxonomic and systematic research, have received considerable long-term public support. The work remaining in systematics has been expanding as the estimated total number of species of organisms on Earth has risen over recent decades, as have estimated numbers of undescribed species. Despite this increasing task, support for taxonomic and systematic research, and biological collections upon which such research is based, has declined over the last 30-40 years, while other areas of biological research have grown considerably, especially those that focus on environmental issues. Reflecting increases in research that deals with ecological questions (e.g. what determines species distribution and abundance) or environmental issues (e.g. toxic pollution), the level of research attempting to use biological collections in museums or herbaria in an ecological/environmental context has risen dramatically during about the last 20 years. The perceived relevance of biological collections, and hence the support they receive, should be enhanced if this trend continues and they are used prominently regarding such environmental issues as anthropogenic loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem function, global climate change, and decay of the epidemiological environment. It is unclear, however, how best to use biological collections in the context of such ecological/environmental issues or how best to manage collections to facilitate such use. We demonstrate considerable and increasingly realized potential for research based on biological collections to contribute to ecological/environmental understanding. However, because biological collections were not originally intended for use regarding such issues and have inherent biases and limitations, they are proving more useful in some contexts than in others. Biological collections have, for example, been particularly useful as sources of information regarding variation in attributes of individuals (e.g. morphology, chemical composition) in relation to environmental variables, and provided important information in relation to species' distributions, but less useful in the contexts of habitat associations and population sizes. Changes to policies, strategies and procedures associated with biological collections could mitigate these biases and limitations, and hence make such collections more useful in the context of ecological/environmental issues. Haphazard and opportunistic collecting could be replaced with strategies for adding to existing collections that prioritize projects that use biological collections and include, besides taxonomy and systematics, a focus on significant environmental/ecological issues. Other potential changes include increased recording of the nature and extent of collecting effort and information associated with each specimen such as nearby habitat and other individuals observed but not collected. Such changes have begun to occur within some institutions. Institutions that house biological collections should, we think, pursue a mission of 'understanding the life of the planet to inform its stewardship' (Krishtalka {\&} Humphrey, 2000), as such a mission would facilitate increased use of biological collections in an ecological/environmental context and hence lead to increased appreciation, encouragement and support from the public for these collections, their associated research, and the institutions that house them.},

Here, we summarize the history of these endosymbiotic concepts to their modern-day derivative, the "serial endosymbiosis theory", which collectively expound on the origin of eukaryotic cell organelles (plastids, mitochondria) and subsequent endosymbiotic events. Additionally, we review recent hypotheses about the origin of the nucleus. Model systems for the study of "endosymbiosis in action" are also described, and the hypothesis that symbiogenesis may contribute to the generation of new species is critically assessed with special reference to the secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis (macroevolution) of unicellular eukaryotic algae. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Between 1994 and 2010, a total of 450 km2 of offshore area, including 218 km 2 of intertidal flats (one third of the original tidal area in the bay), has been reclaimed along the bay for two industrial projects. This has caused the northward migrants to become concentrated in an ever smaller remaining area, our core study site. The spring peak numbers of two Red Knot subspecies in the East Asia-Australasian Flyway, Calidris canutus piersmai and C. c. rogersi, in this so far little affected area increased from 13{\%} in 2007 to 62{\%} in 2010 of the global populations; the spring peak numbers of Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea increased from 3{\%} in 2007 to 23{\%} in 2010 of the flyway population. The decline in the extent of intertidal mudflats also affected Relict Gulls Larus relictus, listed by IUCN as "Vulnerable"; during normal winters 56{\%} of the global population moved from the wintering habitats that were removed in Tianjin to the relatively intact areas around Tangshan. Densities of wintering Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, and spring-staging Broad-billed Sandpiper Limicola falcinellus and Sanderling Calidris alba have also increased in the remaining areas. With the proposed continuation of land reclamation in Bohai Bay, we predict waterbird densities in the remaining areas to increase to a point of collapse. To evaluate the future of these fragile, shared international resources, it is vital to promote an immediate conservation action plan for the remaining coastal wetlands in this region, and continued population monitoring to determine the effects of this action.

To begin to reconcile these perspectives, we studied how the evolutionary conservation of genes associated with social behavior depends on regulatory context, and whether genes associated with social behavior exist in distinct regulatory and evolutionary contexts. We identified modules of co-expressed genes associated with age-based division of labor between nurses and foragers in the ant Monomorium pharaonis, and we studied the relationship between molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression. Highly connected and expressed genes were more evolutionarily conserved, as expected. However, compared to the rest of the genome, forager-upregulated genes were much more highly connected and conserved, while nurse-upregulated genes were less connected and more evolutionarily labile. Our results indicate that the genetic architecture of social behavior includes both highly connected and conserved components as well as loosely connected and evolutionarily labile components.},

abstract = {Migrating birds make the longest non-stop endurance flights in the animal kingdom. Satellite technology is now providing direct evidence on the lengths and durations of these flights and associated staging episodes for individual birds. Using this technology, we compared the migration performance of two subspecies of bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica travelling between non-breeding grounds in New Zealand (subspecies baueri) and northwest Australia (subspecies menzbieri) and breeding grounds in Alaska and eastern Russia, respectively. Individuals of both subspecies made long, usually non-stop, flights from non-breeding grounds to coastal staging grounds in the Yellow Sea region of East Asia (average 10 060 ± SD 290 km for baueri and 5860 ± 240 km for menzbieri). After an average stay of 41.2 ± 4.8 d, baueri flew over the North Pacific Ocean before heading northeast to the Alaskan breeding grounds (6770 ± 800 km). Menzbieri staged for 38.4 ± 2.5 d, and flew over land and sea northeast to high arctic Russia (4170 ± 370 km). The post-breeding journey for baueri involved several weeks of staging in southwest Alaska followed by non-stop flights across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand (11 690 km in a complete track) or stopovers on islands in the southwestern Pacific en route to New Zealand and eastern Australia. By contrast, menzbieri returned to Australia via stopovers in the New Siberian Islands, Russia, and back at the Yellow Sea; birds travelled on average 4510 ± 360 km from Russia to the Yellow Sea, staged there for 40.8 ± 5.6 d, and then flew another 5680?7180 km to Australia (10 820 ± 300 km in total). Overall, the entire migration of the single baueri godwit with a fully completed return track totalled 29 280 km and involved 20 d of major migratory flight over a round-trip journey of 174 d. The entire migrations of menzbieri averaged 21 940 ± 570 km, including 14 d of major migratory flights out of 154 d total. Godwits of both populations exhibit extreme flight performance, and baueri makes the longest (southbound) and second-longest (northbound) non-stop migratory flights documented for any bird. Both subspecies essentially make single stops when moving between non-breeding and breeding sites in opposite hemispheres. This reinforces the critical importance of the intertidal habitats used by fuelling godwits in Australasia, the Yellow Sea, and Alaska.},

abstract = {The previous identification of 2,5-dimethyl-3-(3-methylbutyl)pyrazine as the mandibular alarm pheromone of the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger), has been found to be incorrect. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of ant extracts suggested the correct structure to be the regioisomer 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine, which was confirmed by comparison with the synthetic pyrazine. GC/MS analysis also revealed the presence of an additional disubstituted alkylpyrazine which was identified as 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine. Headspace sampling of confined ants with SPME and Porapak Q followed by GC/MS analysis showed 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine as the major volatile released by W. auropunctata workers while 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine was only detected in trace amounts. In laboratory bioassays, W. auropunctata workers were attracted and arrested by both pyrazines, although the results were not always consistent. Synthetic pyrazines generally attracted as many W. auropunctata workers as were attracted to a single crushed ant. However, higher numbers of W. auropunctata were arrested by crushed ant treatments than by synthetic pyrazines in all bioassays but one.},

The energy requirements for a cell to support its metabolic function can change in response to varying physiological conditions, such as, proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, mitochondrial transcription regulation is constantly being modulated in order to establish efficient mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and proper cellular function. The aim of this article is to review the function of major protein factors that are directly involved in the process of mtDNA transcription regulation, as well as, the importance of mitochondrial nucleoid structure and its influence on mtDNA segregation and transcription regulation. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on the molecular mode of action of transcription factors comprising the mitochondrial transcriptional machinery, as well as the action of nuclear receptors on regulatory regions of the mtDNA.},

abstract = {The Yangtze River Basin in China is one of the global hotspots of freshwater mussel (order Unionida) diversity with 68 nominal species. Few studies have tested the validity of these nominal species. Some taxa from the Yangtze unionid fauna have not been adequately examined using molecular data and well-positioned phylogenetically with respect to the global Unionida. We evaluated species boundaries of Chinese freshwater mussels, and disentangled their phylogenetic relationships within the context of the global freshwater mussels based on the multi-locus data and complete mitochondrial genomes. Moreover, we produced the time-calibrated phylogeny of Unionida and explored patterns of diversification. COI barcode data suggested the existence of 41 phylogenetic distinct species from our sampled 40 nominal taxa inhabiting the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses on three loci (COI, 16S, and 28S) and complete mitochondrial genomes showed that the subfamily Unioninae sensu stricto was paraphyletic, and the subfamily Anodontinae should be subsumed under Unioninae. In addition, we described two new tribes (Aculamprotulini tribe nov. and Lepidodesmini tribe nov.) in the subfamily Unioninae and one new genus (Parvasolenaia gen. nov.) in the subfamily Gonideinae. Molecular dating analysis suggested freshwater mussels diversified at 346.1 Mya (HPD = 286.6–409.9). The global diversification rate for Unionida was estimated to be 0.025 species/Myr. Our study found only a single well-supported rate shift in Unionida diversification, occurring at the base of the subfamily Ambleminae. The evolution of active host-attraction may have triggered the burst of speciation in Ambleminae, and the environment and geography of the Mississippi River Basin likely sustained this radiation.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Thousands of mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced, but there are comparatively few available mitochondrial transcriptomes. This might soon be changing. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) techniques have made it fast and cheap to generate massive amounts of mitochondrial tran-scriptomic data. Here, we explore the utility of RNA-Seq for assembling mitochondrial genomes and studying their expression patterns. Specifically, we investigate the mitochondrial transcriptomes from Polytomella non-photosynthetic green algae, which have among the smallest, most reduced mitochon-drial genomes from the Archaeplastida as well as fragmented rRNA-coding regions, palindromic genes, and linear chromosomes with telomeres. Isolation of whole genomic RNA from the four known Polytomella species followed by Illumina paired-end sequencing generated enough mitochondrial-derived reads to easily recover almost-entire mitochondrial genome sequences. Read-mapping and coverage statistics also gave insights into Polytomella mitochondrial transcriptional architecture, reveal-ing polycistronic transcripts and the expression of telomeres and palindromic genes. Ultimately, RNA-Seq is a promising, cost-effective technique for studying mitochondrial genetics, but it does have drawbacks, which are discussed. One of its greatest potentials, as shown here, is that it can be used to generate near-complete mitochondrial genome sequences, which could be particularly useful in situations where there is a lack of available mtDNA data.},

abstract = {Computer simulations provide a flexible method for assessing the power and robustness of phylogenetic inference methods. Unfortunately, simulated data are often obviously atypical of data encountered in studies of molecular evolution. Unrealistic simulations can lead to conclusions that are irrelevant to real-data analyses or can provide a biased view of which methods perform well. Here, we present a software tool designed to generate data under a complex codon model that allows each residue in the protein sequence to have a different set of equilibrium amino acid frequencies. The software can obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of the Halpern and Bruno model from empirical data and a fixed tree; given an arbitrary tree and a fixed set of parameters, the software can then simulate artificial datasets.We present the results of a simulation experiment using randomly generated tree shapes and substitution parameters estimated from 1610 mammalian cytochrome b sequences.We tested tree inference at the amino acid, nucleotide and codon levels and under parsimony, maximum-likelihood, Bayesian and distance criteria (for a total of more than 650 analyses on each dataset). Based on these simulations, nucleotide-level analyses seem to be more accurate than amino acid and codon analyses. The performance of distance-based phylogenetic methods appears to be quite sensitive to the choice of model and the form of rate heterogeneity used. Further studies are needed to assess the generality of these conclusions. For example, fitting parameters of the Halpern Bruno model to sequences from other genes will reveal the extent to which our conclusions were influenced by the choice of cytochrome b. Incorporating codon bias and more sources heterogeneity into the simulator will be crucial to determining whether the current results are caused by a bias in the current simulation study in favour of nucleotide analyses.},

We compared the recent de novo assemblies using the short oligonucleotide analysis package (SOAP), generated from the genomes of a Han Chinese individual and a Yoruban individual, to experimentally validated genomic features. We found that de novo assemblies were 16.2{\%} shorter than the reference genome and that 420.2 megabase pairs of common repeats and 99.1{\%} of validated duplicated sequences were missing from the genome. Consequently, over 2,377 coding exons were completely missing.

We assessed the influence of inclusion/exclusion of 3rd codon positions, alignment approaches, partition schemes and phylogenetic approaches on topology and nodal support within the Hymenoptera. The results showed that the topologies were sensitive to the variation of dataset and analytical approach. However, some robust and highly supported relationships were recovered: the Ichneumonomorpha was monophyletic; the Trigonalyoidea. +. Megalyroidea and the Diaprioidea. +. Chalcidoidea were consistently recovered; the Cynipoidea was generally recovered as the sister group to the Diaprioidea. +. Chalcidoidea. In addition, the monophyletic Aculeata and Proctotrupomorpha were recovered in some analyses. Several gene rearrangements were detected in each of the three newly sequenced mt genomes. Specifically, the Ibalia leucospoides mt genome harbors a large inversion of a gene block from trnE to trnS2. Inverted, duplicated A. +. T rich regions were detected in the Ibalia leucospoides mt genome, which probably played an important role during the formation of the large gene block inversion via recombination.},

abstract = {Variation in gene expression leads to phenotypic diversity and plays a central role in caste differentiation of eusocial insect species. In social Hymenoptera, females with the same genetic background can develop into queens or workers, which are characterized by divergent morphologies, behaviours and lifespan. Moreover, many social insects exhibit behaviourally distinct worker castes, such as brood-tenders and foragers. Researchers have just started to explore which genes are differentially expressed to achieve this remarkable phenotypic plasticity. Although the queen is normally the only reproductive individual in the nest, following her removal, young brood-tending workers often develop ovaries and start to reproduce. Here, we make use of this ability in the ant Temnothorax longispinosus and compare gene expression patterns in the queens and three worker castes along a reproductive gradient. We found the largest expression differences between the queen and the worker castes ({\~{}}2500 genes) and the smallest differences between infertile brood-tenders and foragers ({\~{}}300 genes). The expression profile of fertile workers is more worker-like, but to a certain extent intermediate between the queen and the infertile worker castes. In contrast to the queen, a high number of differentially expressed genes in the worker castes are of unknown function, pointing to the derived status of hymenopteran workers within insects.},

abstract = {Here we report the complete sequence of mitochondrial genomes for two sister taxa of freshwater teleosts, the recently derived Yarra pigmy perch Nannoperca obscura and the southern pigmy perch Nannoperca australis. These represent the first complete mitochondrial genomes for Percichthyidae (Perciformes), a family mostly distributed in Australia. The de novo genome assembly of 316,430 pyrosequencing reads from 454 libraries has produced the entire mitochondria for N. obscura and a nearly complete version for N. australis. The mtDNA genome from the latter was completed through the design of one primer set and standard Sanger sequencing for genome finishing, followed by the hybrid assembly of reads with MIRA software using N. obscura sequence as reference genome. The complete mitogenomes of N. obscura and N. australis are 16,496 and 16,494 bp in size, respectively. Both genomes contain 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and a control region. Several characteristics of mitochondria typically found in teleost fishes were detected, such as: (i) most genes found in the heavy strand, with the exception of ND6 and eight tRNA genes; (ii) avoidance of G as the third base of codons; (iii) presence of gene overlapping; (iv) percentage of bases usage. We found only eight indels and 197 nucleotide substitutions between these Nannoperca mitogenomes, consistent with a previous hypothesis of recent speciation. The data reported here provide a resource for comparative analysis of recent evolution of mitochondrial genomes.},

abstract = {Several species of Pseudacteon phorid flies, including Pseudacteon cultellatus, P. curvatus, P. obtusus, and P. tricuspis, have been introduced in the southern United States for biological control of imported fire ants, Solenopsis spp. Previous studies showed that Pseudacteon flies use the alarm pheromone and venom alkaloids of fire ants to locate host ant workers. A recent study by our group demonstrated attraction of one of the species, P. tricuspis, to certain alkylpyrazine analogs of fire ant alarm pheromone. If effective, alkylpyrazine analogs of fire ant alarm pheromone may provide cost-efficient alternatives as phorid fly attractants. To test the hypothesis that other phorid fly species are attracted to alkylpyrazine analogs of fire ant alarm pheromone, we compared electroantennogram (EAG) and behavioral responses of four Pseudacteon species, P. cultellatus, P. curvatus, P. obtusus, and P. tricuspis, to the commercially available alarm pheromone isomer (2-ethyl-3,6(or 5)-dimethyl pyrazine) and six structurally related alkylpyrazine analogs at physiologically relevant doses (ranging from picogram to 10 µg). The alarm pheromone isomer and two analogs, 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine and 2 ethyl-3,5 + 6 methyl pyrazine, elicited the strongest EAG activity in all four species at all tested doses. Results from four-choice olfactometer bioassays testing the above three EAG-active compounds showed that all four species were strongly attracted to the alarm pheromone isomer at doses ranging from 0.001 to 1 µg. The flies also showed significant attraction to the two analogs (2,3-diethyl-5-methyl pyrazine and 2 ethyl-3,5 + 6 methyl pyrazine) compared to the solvent control but not as strong as the attraction elicited by the alarm pheromone isomer. These results confirm that multiple species of phorid flies use fire ant alarm pheromone as a host location cue. However, the flies are not strongly attracted to the tested alkylpyrazine analogs of the alarm pheromone.},

abstract = {Abstract  Processes acting on different spatial and temporal scales may influence local species richness. Ant communities are usually described as interactive and therefore determined by local processes. In this paper we tested two hypotheses linked to the question of why there is local variation in arboreal ant species richness in the Brazilian savanna (‘cerrado'). The hypotheses are: (i) there is a positive relationship between ant species richness and tree species richness, used as a surrogate of heterogeneity; and (ii) there is a positive relationship between ant species richness and tree density, used as a surrogate of resource availability. Arboreal ants were sampled in two cerrado sites in Brazil using baited pitfall traps and manual sampling, in quadrats of 20 m × 50 m. Ant species richness in each quadrat was used as the response variable in regression tests, using tree species richness and tree density as explanatory variables. Ant species richness responded positively to tree species richness and density. Sampling site also influenced ant species richness, and the relationship between tree density and tree species richness was also positive and significant. Tree species richness may have influenced ant species richness through three processes: (i) increasing the variety of resources and allowing the existence of a higher number of specialist species; (ii) increasing the amount of resources to generalist species; and (iii) some other unmeasured factor may have influenced both ant and tree species richness. Tree density may also have influenced ant species richness through three processes: (i) increasing the amount of resources and allowing a higher ant species richness; (ii) changing habitat conditions and dominance hierarchies in ant communities; and (iii) increasing the area and causing a species–area pattern. Processes acting on larger scales, such as disturbance, altitude and evolutionary histories, as well as sampling effect may have caused the difference between sites.},

@article{Riedel2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A so called "taxonomic impediment" has been recognized as a major obstacle to biodiversity research for the past two decades. Numerous remedies were then proposed. However, neither significant progress in terms of formal species descriptions, nor a minimum standard for descriptions have been achieved so far. Here, we analyze the problems of traditional taxonomy which often produces keys and descriptions of limited practical value. We suggest that phylogenetics and phenetics had a subtle and so far unnoticed effect on taxonomy leading to inflated species descriptions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: The term "turbo-taxonomy" was recently coined for an approach combining cox1 sequences, concise morphological descriptions by an expert taxonomist, and high-resolution digital imaging to streamline the formal description of larger numbers of new species. We propose a further development of this approach which, together with open access web-publication and automated pushing of content from journal into a wiki, may create the most efficient and sustainable way to conduct taxonomy in the future. On demand, highly concise descriptions can be gradually updated or modified in the fully versioned wiki-framework we use. This means that the visibility of additional data is not compromised, while the original species description -the first version- remains preserved in the wiki, and of course in the journal version. A DNA sequence database with an identification engine replaces an identification key, helps to avoid synonyms and has the potential to detect grossly incorrect generic placements. We demonstrate the functionality of a species-description pipeline by naming 101 new species of hyperdiverse New Guinea Trigonopterus weevils in the open-access journal ZooKeys.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Fast track taxonomy will not only increase speed, but also sustainability of global species inventories. It will be of great practical value to all the other disciplines that depend on a usable taxonomy and will change our perception of global biodiversity. While this approach is certainly not suitable for all taxa alike, it is the tool that will help to tackle many hyperdiverse groups and pave the road for more sustainable comparative studies, e.g. in community ecology, phylogeography and large scale biogeographic studies.},

abstract = {The social complexity that characterizes the eusocial insects strongly affects all aspects of social insect life, including the molecular and evolutionary genetic basis of social insect traits. Quantitative genetic theory and empirical approaches have been developed over the past 60 years specifically to study the genetic implications of social interactions. Surprisingly, given the obvious biological importance of social interactions in social insects, this research tradition has been and continues to be widely overlooked throughout the social insect literature, including in recent sociogenomic studies focused on understanding the molecular underpinnings of social life. Instead, the overwhelming majority of social insect genetic research has relied on conventional genetic approaches developed for solitary organisms focused on the one-to-one association of an individual's genes to its own traits. I survey social insect studies that conclusively demonstrate the importance of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which arise from social interactions, for social insect trait expression and evolution. I explain why these genetically based social effects are expected to be ubiquitous in social insects and I explain the relevance of the IGE framework, originally developed within quantitative genetics, for molecular genetic studies of social insect traits such as behaviour and caste. I discuss the problems of ignoring IGEs and relying solely on conventional direct genetic effect approaches. Finally, I discuss the strong potential of using the IGE approach and other more systems-level-focused approaches to complement conventional reductionist approaches in elucidating the genetic basis of social insect trait expression and evolution.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Thousands of mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced, but there are comparatively few available mitochondrial transcriptomes. This might soon be changing. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) techniques have made it fast and cheap to generate massive amounts of mitochondrial tran-scriptomic data. Here, we explore the utility of RNA-Seq for assembling mitochondrial genomes and studying their expression patterns. Specifically, we investigate the mitochondrial transcriptomes from Polytomella non-photosynthetic green algae, which have among the smallest, most reduced mitochon-drial genomes from the Archaeplastida as well as fragmented rRNA-coding regions, palindromic genes, and linear chromosomes with telomeres. Isolation of whole genomic RNA from the four known Polytomella species followed by Illumina paired-end sequencing generated enough mitochondrial-derived reads to easily recover almost-entire mitochondrial genome sequences. Read-mapping and coverage statistics also gave insights into Polytomella mitochondrial transcriptional architecture, reveal-ing polycistronic transcripts and the expression of telomeres and palindromic genes. Ultimately, RNA-Seq is a promising, cost-effective technique for studying mitochondrial genetics, but it does have drawbacks, which are discussed. One of its greatest potentials, as shown here, is that it can be used to generate near-complete mitochondrial genome sequences, which could be particularly useful in situations where there is a lack of available mtDNA data.},

abstract = {1. Ants are ubiquitous ecosystem engineers and generalist predators and are able to affect ecological communities via both pathways. They are likely to influence any other terrestrial arthropod group either directly or indirectly caused by their high abundance and territoriality. 2. We studied the impact of two ant species common in Central Europe, Myrmica rubra and Lasius niger, on an arthropod community. Colony presence and density of these two ant species were manipulated in a field experiment from the start of ant activity in spring to late summer. 3. The experiment revealed a positive influence of the presence of one ant colony on densities of decomposers, herbivores and parasitoids. However, in the case of herbivores and parasitoids, this effect was reversed in the presence of two colonies. 4. Generally, effects of the two ant species were similar with the exception of their effect on Braconidae parasitoid densities that responded positively to one colony of M. rubra but not of L. niger. 5. Spider density was not affected by ant colony manipulation, but species richness of spiders responded positively to ant presence. This effect was independent of ant colony density, but where two colonies were present, spider richness was significantly greater in plots with two M. rubra colonies than in plots with one colony of each ant species. 6. To test whether the positive ecosystem engineering effects were purely caused by modified properties of the soil, we added in an additional experiment (i) the soil from ant nests (without ants) or (ii) unmodified soil or (iii) ant nests (including ants) to experimental plots. Ant nest soil on its own did not have a significant impact on densities of decomposers, herbivores or predators, which were significantly, and positively, affected by the addition of an intact nest. 7. The results suggest an important role of both ant species in the grassland food web, strongly affecting the densities of decomposers, herbivores and higher trophic levels. We discuss how the relative impact via bottom-up and top-down effects of ants depends on nest density, with a relatively greater top-down predatory impact at higher densities.},

Strumigenys rogeri has spread to many parts of the world through human commerce. However, because S. rogeri workers are so small and slow moving, and they become motionless when disturbed, most people, including field biologists, remain unaware of their presence. To examine the spread of S. rogeri, I compiled specimen records from {\textgreater} 400 sites worldwide. I documented the earliest known S. rogeri records for 67 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major Caribbean islands, US states, and Canadian provinces), including many areas for which I found no previously published records: Antigua, Austral Islands, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Comoro Islands, Grenada, Guadeloupe, {\^{I}}les {\'{E}}parses, Martinique, Nevis, Palau, Philippines, St Kitts, St Lucia, St Martin, and Tanzania. Strumigenys rogeri apparently originated in tropical Africa, where its closest relatives all live, but it has become wide- spread on tropical islands of the Indo-Pacific and the West Indies, and in peninsular Florida. Outside of Africa and Florida, there are only a small number of continental records of S. rogeri, including a few from South and Central America and just one from continental Asia, in peninsular Malaysia. It is unclear whether S. rogeri has not yet spread to these continental areas, whether continental ants have competitively excluded S. rogeri, or whether these ants have been simply overlooked in surveys of diverse continental faunae. There is little information on what impact S. rogeri may be having on the native mesofauna in its exotic range. Key},

abstract = {Field bioassays with Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) show that the alarm pheromone components 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine both attract and arrest ants in a natural environment. Comparisons between lures containing 2,5-dimethyl- 3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine singly and in blends (10:1 and 100:1) based on W. auropunctata extracts, failed to show differences in the time required to attract a given number of ants. This indicates a lack of synergistic effects between the compounds under these test conditions. A dose response assay with 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine showed maximal ant response to a 1 mg pheromone lure, a dose which remained attractive for 8 days under field conditions. Several of the field experiments included peanut butter baits, a lure currently used for detection. However, ant counts at peanut butter baits were not greater than at controls suggesting that peanut butter does not produce volatiles that attract ants. With the aim of developing management applications, a series of bioassays were conducted with 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine in combination with food baits. A separate assay was conducted with Tanglefoot, a sticky catch material. In feeding bioassays, the alarm pheromone decreased consumption of peanut butter and solutions of protein and sugar. Tanglefoot squares failed to catch W. auropunctata with any of the lures tested. The field responses of W. auropunctata to alarm pheromone lures show a mixed potential for control applications. While the strong attraction and longevity of lures is promising, the inability to increase bait consumption or capture ants with Tanglefoot presents obstacles to using these alarm pheromone components for ant management.},

Over the past few years, complete plastid genome sequenc-ing has emerged as a powerful and increasingly accessible tool for plant phylogenetics, facilitated by rapid advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (e.g., Moore et al., 2006 , 2007 , 2010 ; Jansen et al., 2007 ; Cronn et al., 2008 , 2012). Many aspects of the plastid genome, including its structural simplicity, relatively small size, and highly conserved gene con-tent, make it ideally suited for next-generation sequencing and assembly. Additionally, its wealth of characters, useful across many taxonomic levels, makes it an excellent resource for phylogenetic studies across the plant branch of the tree of life. Plastome-scale phylogenetic studies have, for example, clarifi ed relationships among major angiosperm lineages (Moore et al., 2007 , 2010 ; Jansen et al., 2007) and resolved recent, rapid radiations in Pinus (Parks et al., 2009). Plastid genomes also have great po-tential for population genetic and phylogeographic studies (e.g., Whittall et al., 2010), particularly as a complement to multiple unlinked nuclear loci, although this application of large-scale plastid data sets has been underexplored compared to deeper-level phylogenetic studies. The ever-increasing capacities of next-generation sequenc-ers, particularly the Illumina platforms, coupled with the high-copy nature of the plastid genome, have made it possible to multiplex numerous samples of whole-genomic DNA (gDNA) on a single lane and still recover suffi cient coverage to assemble complete or nearly complete plastid genomes (e.g., Cronn et al., 2008 , 2012 ; Steele et al., 2012 ; Straub et al., 2012). However, given that plastid DNA typically constitutes only {\~{}}0.5–13{\%} of gDNA samples (Steele et al., 2012 ; Straub et al., 2012), this approach expends much of the sequencing capacity on nuclear reads, signifi cantly reducing the number of plastomes that can be sequenced in parallel. Consequently, this limits the scalability},

To examine the worldwide distribution of C. biroi, we compiled and mapped specimen records from {\textgreater}100 sites.

All continental records of Cerapachys biroi come from Asia, where populations show notable geographic variation in morphology, suggesting that the species is native to this region. Conversely, the lack of obvious morphological variation among C. biroi specimens from outside mainland Asia suggests that C. biroi is exotic to these regions. Outside Asia, all records of C. biroi come from islands, possibly due to reduced competition with dominant ants in island habitats. Perhaps the many dominant native and exotic ant species in continental regions have prevented widespread establishment of C. biroi.},

abstract = {Ants (Formicidae) represent a taxonomically diverse group of hymenopterans with over 13,000 extant species, the majority of which inject or spray secretions from a venom gland. The evolutionary success of ants is mostly due to their unique eusociality that has permitted them to develop complex collaborative strategies, partly involving their venom secretions, to defend their nest against predators, microbial pathogens, ant competitors, and to hunt prey. Activities of ant venom include paralytic, cytolytic, haemolytic, allergenic, pro-inflammatory, insecticidal, antimicrobial, and pain-producing pharmacologic activities, while non-toxic functions include roles in chemical communication involving trail and sex pheromones, deterrents, and aggregators. While these diverse activities in ant venoms have until now been largely understudied due to the small venom yield from ants, modern analytical and venomic techniques are beginning to reveal the diversity of toxin structure and function. As such, ant venoms are distinct from other venomous animals, not only rich in linear, dimeric and disulfide-bonded peptides and bioactive proteins, but also other volatile and non-volatile compounds such as alkaloids and hydrocarbons. The present review details the unique structures and pharmacologies of known ant venom proteinaceous and alkaloidal toxins and their potential as a source of novel bioinsecticides and therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial sequences have long been used to examine vertebrate phylogenetic relationships. The extensive use of mitochondrial data reflects the ease of obtaining mitochondrial sequences and its relatively rapid coalescence time. Mitochondrial genomes typically do not undergo recombination, so the entire mitogenome should have the same underlying gene tree. Thus, given appropriate analyses, conflict among estimates of phylogeny from different mitochondrial regions should not exist. However, estimates of phylogeny based upon different mitochondrial regions can exhibit incongruence. Conflict in phylogenetic signal among mitochondrial regions has been observed in galliform birds for the position of the Odontophoridae (New World quail). To explore this, we expanded sampling to 47 galliform mitogenomes, adding six new mitogenomes, which included representatives of two previously unsampled families. Analyses of complete mitogenomes recovered a well-supported topology that was congruent with expectations from multi-locus studies. However, when analyzing individual regions, we found conflicting positions for the Odontophoridae and several other relationships at multiple taxonomic levels. We tested multiple analytical strategies to reduce incongruence among regions, including partitioning by codon position, using mixture and codon-based models, RY coding, and excluding potentially misleading sites. No approach consistently reduced the conflict among mitochondrial regions at any taxonomic level. The biological attributes of both strongly misleading and non-misleading sites were essentially identical. Increasing taxa actually appeared to increase conflicting signal, even when taxa were selected to break up long branches. Collectively, our results indicate that analyzing mitochondrial data remains difficult, although analyzing complete mitogenomes resulted in a good estimate of the mitochondrial gene tree. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper, we tested four hypotheses relative to edge and shape effects on ant communities: (i) forest edges have lower species richness than the remnant core; (ii) species richness increases with distance from the edge; (iii) irregularly shaped remnants have lower species richness than more regular remnants; (iv) there is a higher similarity of species composition between edge and core in irregular than in regular remnants. We sampled litter ant communities on the edge and core of ten remnants, in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Species richness was larger at the forest core than at the edges, although did not increase with distance from the edge. Species richness did not vary with shape complexity. The similarity of species composition between edge and core showed a decreasing trend with remnant area, and did not vary with shape complexity. The observed differences of species richness between forest core and edge may be due to higher harshness of edges, caused by environmental changes. The absence of relationship between species richness and distance from the edge might indicate the range of edge effects, which would be smaller than the smallest distance of core sampled. Therefore, edges would affect litter-dwelling ant species richness in a distance smaller than 50 m. The observation of species composition allowed us to notice an effect of fragmentation that would not be noticed if we were considering only species richness. Edge may serve as step to generalist species, which may use it to colonise forest remnants. Furthermore, small remnants are more colonisation-prone by such species, and have a more homogeneous species composition than large remnants.},

A solution is a web-based Geographic Information System for enabling visualization and analysis of this rapidly expanding data resource. In this paper we detail a case study system, GBIF Mapping and Analysis Portal Application (MAPA), developed for deployment at distributed database portals. Building such a system requires overcoming a series of technical and research challenges. These challenges include: assuring fast speed of access to the vast amounts of data available through these distributed biodiversity databases; developing open standards based access to suitable environmental data layers for analyzing biodiversity distribution; building suitably flexible and intuitive map interfaces for refining the scope and criteria of an analysis; and building appropriate web-services based analysis tools that are of primary importance to the ecological community and make manifest the value of online biodiversity GBIF data.

abstract = {Background: Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector of tick-borne diseases in Europe. A better knowledge of its genome and transcriptome is important for developing control strategies. Previous transcriptomic studies of I. ricinus have focused on gene expression during the blood meal in specific tissues. To obtain a broader picture of changes in gene expression during the blood meal, our study analysed the transcriptome at the level of the whole body for both nymphal and adult ticks. Ixodes ricinus ticks from a highly inbred colony at the University of Neuch{\^{a}}tel were used. We also analysed previously published RNAseq studies to compare the genetic variation between three wild strains and three laboratory strains, including the strain from Neuch{\^{a}}tel. Results: RNA was extracted from whole tick bodies and the cDNA was sequenced, producing 162,872,698 paired-end reads. Our reference transcriptome contained 179,316 contigs, of which 31{\%} were annotated using Trinotate. Gene expression was compared between ticks that differed by feeding status (unfed vs partially fed). We found that blood-feeding in nymphs and female adult ticks increased the expression of cuticle-associated genes. Using a set of 3866 single nucleotide polymorphisms to calculate the heterozygosity, we found that the wild tick populations of I. ricinus had much higher levels of heterozygosity than the three laboratory populations. Conclusion: Using high throughput strand-oriented sequencing for whole ticks in different stages and feeding conditions, we obtained a de novo assembly that significantly increased the genomic resources available for I. ricinus. Our study illustrates the importance of analysing the transcriptome at the level of the whole body to gain additional insights into how gene expression changes over the life-cycle of an organism. Our comparison of several RNAseq datasets shows the power of transcriptomic data to accurately characterize genetic polymorphism and for comparing different populations or sources of sequencing material.},

The current methodology was effective to assemble the whole mitogenome using 2008 mitochondrial reads representing 0.23{\%} of total genomic reads produced and providing average mitogenome coverage of 17.4 reads per site. The whole mitogenome sequence provided here is deposited in NCBI with the accession number KJ130031 and may benefit systematics studies and conservation programs of M. adspersa.},

abstract = {Prolonged unaccustomed exercise involving muscle lengthening (eccentric) actions can result in ultrastructural muscle disruption, impaired excitation-contraction coupling, inflammation and muscle protein degradation. This process is associated with delayed onset muscle soreness and is referred to as exercise-induced muscle damage. Although a certain amount of muscle damage may be necessary for adaptation to occur, excessive damage or inadequate recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage can increase injury risk, particularly in older individuals, who experience more damage and require longer to recover from muscle damaging exercise than younger adults. Furthermore, it is apparent that inter-individual variation exists in the response to exercise-induced muscle damage, and there is evidence that genetic variability may play a key role. Although this area of research is in its infancy, certain gene variations, or polymorphisms have been associated with exercise-induced muscle damage (i.e. individuals with certain genotypes experience greater muscle damage, and require longer recovery, following strenuous exercise). These polymorphisms include ACTN3 (R577X, rs1815739), TNF (-308 G{\textgreater}A, rs1800629), IL6 (-174 G{\textgreater}C, rs1800795), and IGF2 (ApaI, 17200 G{\textgreater}A, rs680). Knowing how someone is likely to respond to a particular type of exercise could help coaches/practitioners individualise the exercise training of their athletes/patients, thus maximising recovery and adaptation, while reducing overload-associated injury risk. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical analysis of the literature concerning gene polymorphisms associated with exercise-induced muscle damage, both in young and older individuals, and to highlight the potential mechanisms underpinning these associations, thus providing a better understanding of exercise-induced muscle damage.},

The energy requirements for a cell to support its metabolic function can change in response to varying physiological conditions, such as, proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, mitochondrial transcription regulation is constantly being modulated in order to establish efficient mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and proper cellular function. The aim of this article is to review the function of major protein factors that are directly involved in the process of mtDNA transcription regulation, as well as, the importance of mitochondrial nucleoid structure and its influence on mtDNA segregation and transcription regulation.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate levels of expression of two major genes, the odorant binding protein Gp-9 (general protein-9) and foraging, that have been shown to be associated with behavioural polymorphisms in ants. We analysed workers and young nonreproductive queens collected from nests of the monogyne (single reproductive queen per nest) and polygyne (multiple reproductive queens) social forms of Solenopsis invicta. In workers but not young queens, the level of foraging expression was significantly associated with social form and the task performed (ie localization in the nest or foraging area). The level of expression of Gp-9 was also associated with social form and worker localization. In addition there was a higher level of expression of the Gp-9b allele compared with the Gp-9B allele in the heterozygote workers and the young nonreproductive queens. Finally, in the polygyne colonies the level of expression of foraging was not significantly associated with the Gp-9 genotype for either workers or young nonreproductive queens, suggesting that both genes have independent non-epistatic effects on behaviour in S. invicta.},

abstract = {The South American big-headed ant Pheidole obscurithorax was first found in North America in Mobile, Alabama in 1949. Since then, this species has also been recorded in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. We compiled and mapped published and unpublished specimen records of P. obscurithorax from {\textgreater}170 sites in South America and the US to evaluate the current geographic range of this species and its possible future spread. We documented the earliest known records for nine geographic areas (South American countries and US states). Site records of P. obscurithorax ranged 27.5 degrees of latitude (from 6.7°S to 34.2°S) in South America, and 3.5 degrees of latitude (from 28.0°N to 31.5°N) in North America. It may be that the North American populations of P. obscurithorax have a fairly narrow range of climatic tolerances. Earlier genetic analyses of native and exotic populations of P. obscurithorax found that the North America populations appear to originate from a single introduction from a population most closely related to native study populations from a stretch along the Paran{\'{a}} River in Argentina from Resistencia (27.5°S) to Santa Fe (31.6°S). This latitudinal range matches the current latitudinal range of P. obscurithorax in North America. Alternatively, the much greater latitudinal range of P. obscurithorax in South America suggests that exotic populations of P. obscurithorax may have potential for much additional expansion in North America and beyond. In South America, P. obscurithorax has a similar native range as the invasive fire ant Solenopsis invicta . In the North America, exotic populations of P. obscurithorax may spread like S. invicta has, across the southeast of the US and into the West Indies},

abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been the workhorse of research in phylogeography for almost two decades. However, concerns with basing evolutionary interpretations on mtDNA results alone have been voiced since the inception of such studies. Recently, some authors have suggested that the potential problems with mtDNA are so great that inferences about population structure and species limits are unwarranted unless corroborated by other evidence, usually in the form of nuclear gene data. Here we review the relative merits of mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeographical studies, using birds as an exemplar class of organisms. A review of population demographic and genetic theory indicates that mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeographical results ought to concur for both geographically unstructured populations and for populations that have long histories of isolation. However, a relatively common occurrence will be shallow, but geographically structured mtDNA trees--without nuclear gene corroboration--for populations with relatively shorter periods of isolation. This is expected because of the longer coalescence times of nuclear genes (approximately four times that of mtDNA); such cases do not contradict the mtDNA inference of recent isolation and evolutionary divergence. Rather, the nuclear markers are more lagging indicators of changes in population structure. A review of the recent literature on birds reveals the existence of relatively few cases in which nuclear markers contradict mitochondrial markers in a fashion not consistent with coalescent theory. Preliminary information from nuclear genes suggests that mtDNA patterns will prove to be robust indicators of patterns of population history and species limits. At equilibrium, mitochondrial loci are generally a more sensitive indicator of population structure than are nuclear loci, and mitochondrial estimates of F(ST)-like statistics are generally expected to exceed nuclear ones. Hence, invoking behavioural or ecological explanations of such differences is not parsimonious. Nuclear genes will prove important for quantitative estimates of the depths of haplotype trees, rates of population growth and values of gene flow.},

I documented the earliest known S. membranifera records for 74 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major Caribbean islands, and US states), including many areas for which I found no previously published records: Arizona, Arkansas, Barbados, Barbuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Comoro Islands, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Iles Eparses, India, Madagascar, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Lucia, St Martin, Tobago, Trinidad, and Turks {\&} Caicos Islands. Strumigenys membranifera is one of three Old World dacetine ants, along with Strumigenys rogeri EMERY, 1890 and Strumigenys emmae (EMERY, 1890), with widespread records in both the Old World and the New World. Whereas S. rogeri and S. emmae are almost exclusively tropical, S. membranifera has spread to higher latitudes. Strumigenys membranifera is the only one of the three species with outdoor populations in Europe, e.g., S. membranifera is common in urban parks of southern Spain. In the continental US, S. membranifera has been found in 12 southern states, whereas S. rogeri and S. emmae have outdoor populations only in peninsular Florida. Strumigenys membranifera occurs in a broad range of habitats, including dense forest, cultivated fields, urban lawns, and gardens.

abstract = {Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

abstract = {The ongoing molecular revolution in ant systematics, of which Ross Crozier was an early proponent and practitioner, has led to remarkable progress in our understanding of ant phylogeny. In this review I consider the interplay between molecular and morphological evidence, and the integration of molecular phylogenetic results into ant classification. New phylogenetic findings indicate that most ant subfamilies and genera are monophyletic, but there are some significant exceptions, including the subfamily Cerapachyinae and several large and species-rich ant genera (Amblyopone, Aphaeno- gaster, Camponotus, Cerapachys, Messor and Pachycondyla, among others). These non-monophyletic groups are mani- festations of two different phenomena: (1) convergence in morphology and (2) heterogeneity in rates of morphological evolution. Granivorous ants in the genus Messor are an example of the former: molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that the New World and Old World Messor are separate lineages that independently evolved similar derived morphology. Heterogeneity in rates of evolution is exemplified by highly divergent army ants and certain other dorylomorphs – cur- rently assigned to different genera, tribes and subfamilies – that are nested phylogenetically within a group of morpho- logically plesiomorphic species, most of which are placed in a single genus (Cerapachys). This presents a classificatory conundrum if we wish to maintain a Linnaean (i.e., ranked) classification system in which all named taxa are mono- phyletic and easily diagnosed. Nevertheless, despite the conceptual appeal of a rank-free classification (as embodied in the PhyloCode), there are practical advantages to maintaining a ranked phylogenetic taxonomy, at least for groups such as ants that are in relatively recent and species-rich branches of the tree of life. These benefits include explicit information about the inclusivity and exclusivity of clades, and identification (through binomial nomenclature) of those taxa that are considered to represent species. It is important to recognize that the assignment of family-group or genus-group rank to clades is arbitrary and that ant taxa of a given rank are not equivalent, except in a very approximate sense. A new modus operandi is emerging in ant taxonomy above the species level, wherein molecular (DNA sequence) data from multiple nuclear genes are used to generate a well supported phylogeny, and the resulting tree serves as a framework for evaluating the informativeness of morphological traits and for identifying (and naming) clades that can be diagnosed morphologi- cally. In following this protocol an attempt should be made to maintain continuity in nomenclature and taxon concepts with the preexisting classification, to the extent that this is possible. A similar set of principles has been followed by plant systematists developing a ranked phylogenetic classification of flowering plants (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system).},

abstract = {It is now well recognized that considering species evolu-tionary history is crucial for understanding the processes driving community assembly (Cavender-Bares et al. 2009). Considerable efforts have been made to integrate phylogenetics and community ecology into a single theo-retical framework. Yet, assessing phylogenetic structure at the community scale remains a great challenge, in par-ticular for poorly known organisms. While DNA meta-barcoding is increasingly used for assessing taxonomic composition of complex communities from environmental samples, biases and limitations of this technique can pre-clude the retrieval of information on phylogenetic com-munity structure. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, And ujar et al. (2015) demonstrate that shotgun sequenc-ing of bulk samples of soil beetles and subsequent reconstruction of mitochondrial genomes can provide a solid phylogenetic framework to estimate species diver-sity and gain insights into the mechanisms underlying the spatial turnover of soil mesofaunal assemblages. This work highlights the enormous potential of 'metagenome skimming' not only for improving the current standards of DNA-based biodiversity assessment but also for open-ing up the application of phylogenetic community ecol-ogy to hyperdiverse and poorly known biota, which was heretofore inconceivable. Preventing biodiversity decline requires efficient techniques to understand community assembly and dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. DNA metabarcoding has been proposed as a promising alternative to classical taxonomic approaches for high-throughput biodiversity assessment and is currently becoming a standard in biodi-versity research. Yet, it still suffers from several limitations including PCR biases, which may lead to an overestima-tion/distortion of species diversity and abundances, a pos-sible lack of taxonomic/phylogenetic resolution, the need to select suitable barcode regions and design versatile primers, as well as the requirement for extensive barcode reference databases. It has been three years since Taberlet et al. (2012) predicted that rapid advances in sequencing technology would overcome DNA metabarcoding limita-tions through shallow shotgun sequencing of specimens or environmental DNA. This approach would take advantage of the high proportion of plastid, mitochondrial or nuclear ribosomal DNA in a (meta)genome and would hence maxi-mize the reliability and representativeness of sample diver-sity while minimizing sequencing depths and costs. It hence differs from classical (meta)genomics, which rather aim at characterizing full phylogenetic and functional information of the sample, and therefore remains hardly applicable from a high-throughput perspective as they require much deeper sequencing coverage (Fig 1). These predictions are now fulfilled: genome skimming on specimens allows cost-effective construction of reference libraries of whole organellar genomes and repetitive ribo-somal nuclear DNA (Straub et al. 2012; Mal e et al. 2014). Recent studies have further confirmed the possibility to recover and assemble correctly partial or full mitochondrial genomes from bulk arthropod samples (Zhou et al. 2013; Gillett et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2014), allowing to reconstruct well-supported phylogenetic trees, even for deeper evolu-tionary relationships (Gillett et al. 2014; Crampton-Platt et al. 2015) and avoiding false positives in species detection (G omez-Rodr ıguez et al. 2015). Additionally, shotgun sequencing of bulk arthropod samples has revealed a strong correlation between the recovered number of reads and the total biomass of each species (abundance x body length; see Zhou et al. 2013; G omez-Rodr ıguez et al. 2015). By providing increased power for species identification and phylogenetic reconstruction, as well as the potential to assess relative species abundances, 'metagenome skim-ming' (Linard et al. 2015; Fig. 1) hence opens a new era in high-throughput biodiversity assessment. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, And ujar et al. (2015) demonstrate the applicability of metagenome skimming for evaluating phylogenetic composition and turnover of poorly known arthropod communities. Their methodology attempts to circumvent the taxonomic impediment and the absence of comprehensive reference databases by combin-ing read-based analyses (i.e. mapping of sequence reads against known reference databases of full mitochondrial},

abstract = {Sequencing microRNA, reduced representation sequencing, Hi-C technology and any method requiring the use of in-house barcodes result in sequencing libraries with low initial sequence diversity. Sequencing such data on the Illumina platform typically produces low quality data due to the limitations of the Illumina cluster calling algorithm. Moreover, even in the case of diverse samples, these limitations are causing substantial inaccuracies in multiplexed sample assignment (sample bleeding). Such inaccuracies are unacceptable in clinical applications, and in some other fields (e.g. detection of rare variants). Here, we discuss how both problems with quality of low-diversity samples and sample bleeding are caused by incorrect detection of clusters on the flowcell during initial sequencing cycles. We propose simple software modifications (Long Template Protocol) that overcome this problem. We present experimental results showing that our Long Template Protocol remarkably increases data quality for low diversity samples, as compared with the standard analysis protocol; it also substantially reduces sample bleeding for all samples. For comprehensiveness, we also discuss and compare experimental results from alternative approaches to sequencing low diversity samples. First, we discuss how the low diversity problem, if caused by barcodes, can be avoided altogether at the barcode design stage. Second and third, we present modified guidelines, which are more stringent than the manufacturer's, for mixing low diversity samples with diverse samples and lowering cluster density, which in our experience consistently produces high quality data from low diversity samples. Fourth and fifth, we present rescue strategies that can be applied when sequencing results in low quality data and when there is no more biological material available. In such cases, we propose that the flowcell be re-hybridized and sequenced again using our Long Template Protocol. Alternatively, we discuss how analysis can be repeated from saved sequencing images using the Long Template Protocol to increase accuracy.},

Without its control region, it has a total length of 15,485 bp, consisting of 37 genes: 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. Except for eight tRNAs and the nd6 gene, all other mitochondrial genes are encoded on the heavy strand. ATG and ATC act mainly as the initial codon in 10 protein-coding genes, whereas nd2 and cox1 use ATT and nad3 uses ATA. Gene order is generally consistent with that observed in closely-related families. The cloverleaf structures for trnS1 and trnC lacked the DHU-stem and DHU-loop, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of mitogenomes of closely-related families indicate that Brachycephalidae is more closely-related to Craugastoridae than to Eleutherodactylidae.

abstract = {Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been successfully used in phylogenomics for a variety of taxa, but their power in phylogenetic inference has yet to be extensively compared with that of traditional Sanger sequencing data sets. Moreover, UCE data on invertebrates, including insects, are sparse. We compared the phylogenetic informativeness of 959 UCE loci with a multi-locus data set of ten nuclear markers obtained via Sanger sequencing, testing the ability of these two types of data to resolve and date the evolutionary history of the second most species-rich subfamily of ants in the world, the Formicinae. Phylogenetic analyses show that UCEs are superior in resolving ancient and shallow relationships in formicine ants, demonstrated by increased node support and a more resolved phylogeny. Phylogenetic informativeness metrics indicate a twofold improvement relative to the 10-gene data matrix generated from the identical set of taxa. We were able to significantly improve formicine classification based on our comprehensive UCE phylogeny. Our divergence age estimations, using both UCE and Sanger data, indicate that crown-group Formicinae are older (104–117 Ma) than previously suggested. Biogeographic analyses infer that the diversification of the subfamily has occurred on all continents with no particular hub of cladogenesis. We found UCEs to be far superior to the multi-locus data set in estimating formicine relationships. The early history of the clade remains uncertain due to ancient rapid divergence events that are unresolvable even with our genomic-scale data, although this might be largely an effect of several problematic taxa subtended by long branches. Our comparison of divergence ages from both Sanger and UCE data demonstrates the effectiveness of UCEs for dating analyses. This comparative study highlights both the promise and limitations of UCEs for insect phylogenomics, and will prove useful to the growing number of evolutionary biologists considering the transition from Sanger to next-generation sequencing approaches.},

The discovery that terrestrial insects (Hexapoda) are more closely related to aquatic Crustacea than to the terrestrial centipedes and millipedes (Myriapoda) was an early, if exceptional, success. More typically, analyses based on limited samples of taxa and genes have generated results that are inconsistent, weakly supported and highly sensitive to analytical conditions. Here we present strongly supported results from likelihood, Bayesian and parsimony analyses of over 41 kilobases of aligned DNA sequence from 62 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes from 75 arthropod species. These species represent every major arthropod lineage, plus five species of tardigrades and onychophorans as outgroups. Our results strongly support Pancrustacea (Hexapoda plus Crustacea) but also strongly favour the traditional morphology-based Mandibulata (Myriapoda plus Pancrustacea) over the molecule-based Paradoxopoda (Myriapoda plus Chelicerata). In addition to Hexapoda, Pancrustacea includes three major extant lineages of 'crustaceans', each spanning a significant range of morphological disparity. These are Oligostraca (ostracods, mystacocarids, branchiurans and pentastomids), Vericrustacea (malacostracans, thecostracans, copepods and branchiopods) and Xenocarida (cephalocarids and remipedes). Finally, within Pancrustacea we identify Xenocarida as the long-sought sister group to the Hexapoda, a result confirming that 'crustaceans' are not monophyletic. These results provide a statistically well-supported phylogenetic framework for the largest animal phylum and represent a step towards ending the often-heated, century-long debate on arthropod relationships.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous study of higher-level arthropod phylogeny, analyses of nucleotide sequences from 62 protein-coding nuclear genes for 80 panarthopod species yielded significantly higher bootstrap support for selected nodes than did amino acids. This study investigates the cause of that discrepancy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hypothesis is tested that failure to distinguish the serine residues encoded by two disjunct clusters of codons (TCN, AGY) in amino acid analyses leads to this discrepancy. In one test, the two clusters of serine codons (Ser1, Ser2) are conceptually translated as separate amino acids. Analysis of the resulting 21-amino-acid data matrix shows striking increases in bootstrap support, in some cases matching that in nucleotide analyses. In a second approach, nucleotide and 20-amino-acid data sets are artificially altered through targeted deletions, modifications, and replacements, revealing the pivotal contributions of distinct Ser1 and Ser2 codons. We confirm that previous methods of coding nonsynonymous nucleotide change are robust and computationally efficient by introducing two new degeneracy coding methods. We demonstrate for degeneracy coding that neither compositional heterogeneity at the level of nucleotides nor codon usage bias between Ser1 and Ser2 clusters of codons (or their separately coded amino acids) is a major source of non-phylogenetic signal. CONCLUSIONS: The incongruity in support between amino-acid and nucleotide analyses of the forementioned arthropod data set is resolved by showing that "standard" 20-amino-acid analyses yield lower node support specifically when serine provides crucial signal. Separate coding of Ser1 and Ser2 residues yields support commensurate with that found by degenerated nucleotides, without introducing phylogenetic artifacts. While exclusion of all serine data leads to reduced support for serine-sensitive nodes, these nodes are still recovered in the ML topology, indicating that the enhanced signal from Ser1 and Ser2 is not qualitatively different from that of the other amino acids.},

Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two biodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using {\textgreater}1,600 samples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous plant studies, we assessed to what extent a "DNA barcoding gap" is present between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple accessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy amplification, and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK gene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we further demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories. In addition, analyzing {\textgreater}1,000 species of Mesoamerican orchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and proves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Hydrozoans display the most morphological diversity within the phylum Cnidaria. While recent molecular studies have provided some insights into their evolutionary history, sister group relationships remain mostly unresolved, particularly at mid-taxonomic levels. Specifically, within Hydroidolina, the most speciose hydrozoan subclass, the relationships and sometimes integrity of orders are highly unsettled. Here we obtained the near complete mitochondrial sequence of twenty-six hydroidolinan hydrozoan species from a range of sources (DNA and RNA-seq data, long-range PCR). Our analyses confirm previous inference of the evolution of mtDNA in Hydrozoa while introducing a novel genome organization. Using RNA-seq data, we propose a mechanism for the expression of mitochondrial mRNA in Hydroidolina that can be extrapolated to the other medusozoan taxa. Phylogenetic analyses using the full set of mitochondrial gene sequences provide some insights into the order-level relationships within Hydroidolina, including siphonophores as the first diverging clade, a well-supported clade comprised of Leptothecata-Filifera III–IV, and a second clade comprised of Aplanulata-Capitata {\textless}italic{\textgreater}s.s.{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -Filifera I–II. Finally, we describe our relatively inexpensive and accessible multiplexing strategy to sequence long-range PCR amplicons that can be adapted to most high-throughput sequencing platforms. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The world's natural history collections constitute an enormous evidence base for scientific research on the natural world. To facilitate these studies and improve access to collections, many organisations are embarking on major programmes of digitization. This requires auto- mated approaches to mass-digitization that support rapid imaging of specimens and associ- ated data capture, in order to process the tens of millions of specimens common to most natural history collections. In this paper we present Inselect—a modular, easy-to-use, cross-platform suite of open-source software tools that supports the semi-automated pro- cessing of specimen images generated by natural history digitization programmes. The software is made up of a Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux desktop application, together with command-line tools that are designed for unattended operation on batches of images. Blending image visualisation algorithms that automatically recognise specimens together with workflows to support post-processing tasks such as barcode reading, label transcrip- tion and metadata capture, Inselect fills a critical gap to increase the rate of specimen digitization.},

As usually described, this theory posits that mitochondria are the direct descendants of a bacterial endosymbiont that became established at an early stage in a nucleus-containing (but amitochondriate) host cell. Gene sequence data strongly support a monophyletic origin of the mitochondrion from a eubacterial ancestor shared with a subgroup of the alpha-Proteobacteria. However, recent studies of unicellular eukaryotes (protists), some of them little known, have provided insights that challenge the traditional serial endosymbiosis-based view of how the eukaryotic cell and its mitochondrion came to be. These data indicate that the mitochondrion arose in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this organelle originated at essentially the same time as the nuclear component of the eukaryotic cell rather than in a separate, subsequent event.},

abstract = {Ants are the world's most diverse and ecologically dominant eusocial organisms. Resolving the phylogeny and timescale for major ant lineages is vital to understanding how they achieved this success. Morphological, molecular, and paleontological studies, however, have presented conflicting views on early ant evolution. To address these issues, we generated the largest ant molecular phylogenetic data set published to date, containing ≈6 kb of DNA sequence from 162 species representing all 20 ant subfamilies and 10 aculeate outgroup families. When these data were analyzed with and without outgroups, which are all distantly related to ants and hence long-branched, we obtained conflicting ingroup topologies for some early ant lineages. This result casts strong doubt on the existence of a poneroid clade as currently defined. We compare alternate attachments of the outgroups to the ingroup tree by using likelihood tests, and find that several alternative rootings cannot be rejected by the data. These alternatives imply fundamentally different scenarios for the early evolution of ant morphology and behavior. Our data strongly support several notable relationships within the more derived formicoid ants, including placement of the enigmatic subfamily Aenictogitoninae as sister to Dorylus army ants. We use the molecular data to estimate divergence times, employing a strategy distinct from previous work by incorporating the extensive fossil record of other aculeate Hymenoptera as well as that of ants. Our age estimates for the most recent common ancestor of extant ants range from ≈115 to 135 million years ago, indicating that a Jurassic origin is highly unlikely.},

Technological developments in molecular genetics have led to extensive use of neutral molecular markers such as microsatellites in conservation biology. This has allowed assessment of the impact of genetic drift on genetic variation, of the level of inbreeding within populations, and of the amount of gene flow between or within populations. Recent developments in genomic techniques, including next generation sequencing, whole genome scans and gene-expression pattern analysis, have made it possible to step up from a limited number of neutral markers to genome-wide estimates of functional genetic variation. Here, we focus on how the transition of conservation genetics to conservation genomics leads to insights into the dynamics of selectively important variation and its interaction with environmental conditions, and into the mechanisms behind this interaction. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The African green and bush snakes of the genus Philothamnus currently comprises 21 species and three subspecies and occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The genus has been the subject of previous taxonomic revisions based on traditional morphological characters and limited genetic assessment, and may not reflect their evolutionary history. Indeed, previous findings based on phylogenetics show discordant results of interspecific relationships and question the monophyly of the genus, although taxon sampling has been limited to date. We investigated phylogenetic affinities within Philothamnus with more inclusive genetic and geographical sampling, with the aim of better understanding their evolutionary history, so that future taxonomic revision of Philothamnus can be better informed. Species relationships were examined within a phylogenetic context and sampling included 133 ingroup samples from 16 taxa. Phylogenies were constructed in Bayesian and likelihood frameworks using three mitochondrial (16S, cyt b and ND4) and two nuclear (c-mos and RAG1) markers. Competing hypotheses relating to the monophyly of the genus were tested with a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. To examine species boundaries, Bayesian General Mixed Yule-Coalescent Model and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes analyses were conducted. In addition, a barcoding approach was used to further clarify species-level relationships by comparing frequency distributions between intra- and interspecific sequence divergence. The genus was recovered as monophyletic; however, species-delimitation results suggest that the current taxonomy does not reflect the evolutionary history of this group. For example, Philothamnus s. semivariegatus is paraphyletic, with at least four distinct clades. Philothamnus carinatus consists of two cryptic (sister) lineages from Central and West Africa that are deeply divergent, suggesting a long history of isolation between those regions. Furthermore, the subspecies P. n. natalensis and P. n. occidentalis show strong support for species-level divergence, which reflects their morphological and ecological differences. Accordingly, we elevate P. occidentalis nov. comb. to a full species. A fully informed taxonomic revision of these taxa will require additional morphological and ecological data for corroboration, but it seems that the morphological characters (e.g. scalation, dentition) used to describe these species to date are labile within and between species. This most likely has clouded our understanding of the species boundaries within the genus. Our phylogeny and species-delimitation analyses should provide a sounder framework for taxonomy, but may also prove useful toward understanding the morphological adaptations of these species to their respective habitats.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been the workhorse of research in phylogeography for almost two decades. However, concerns with basing evolutionary interpretations on mtDNA results alone have been voiced since the inception of such studies. Recently, some authors have suggested that the potential problems with mtDNA are so great that inferences about population structure and species limits are unwarranted unless corroborated by other evidence, usually in the form of nuclear gene data. Here we review the relative merits of mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeographical studies, using birds as an exemplar class of organisms. A review of population demographic and genetic theory indicates that mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeographical results ought to concur for both geographically unstructured populations and for populations that have long histories of isolation. However, a relatively common occurrence will be shallow, but geographically structured mtDNA trees--without nuclear gene corroboration--for populations with relatively shorter periods of isolation. This is expected because of the longer coalescence times of nuclear genes (approximately four times that of mtDNA); such cases do not contradict the mtDNA inference of recent isolation and evolutionary divergence. Rather, the nuclear markers are more lagging indicators of changes in population structure. A review of the recent literature on birds reveals the existence of relatively few cases in which nuclear markers contradict mitochondrial markers in a fashion not consistent with coalescent theory. Preliminary information from nuclear genes suggests that mtDNA patterns will prove to be robust indicators of patterns of population history and species limits. At equilibrium, mitochondrial loci are generally a more sensitive indicator of population structure than are nuclear loci, and mitochondrial estimates of F(ST)-like statistics are generally expected to exceed nuclear ones. Hence, invoking behavioural or ecological explanations of such differences is not parsimonious. Nuclear genes will prove important for quantitative estimates of the depths of haplotype trees, rates of population growth and values of gene flow.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {The Gp-9 gene in fire ants represents an important model system for studying the evolution of social organization in insects as well as a rich source of information relevant to other major evolutionary topics. An important feature of this system is that polymorphism in social organization is completely associated with allelic variation at Gp-9, such that single-queen colonies (monogyne form) include only inhabitants bearing B-like alleles while multiple-queen colonies (polygyne form) additionally include inhabitants bearing b-like alleles. A recent study of this system by Leal and Ishida (2008) made two major claims, the validity and significance of which we examine here. After reviewing existing literature, analyzing the methods and results of Leal and Ishida (2008), and generating new data from one of their study sites, we conclude that their claim that polygyny can occur in Solenopsis invicta in the U.S.A. in the absence of expression of the b-like allele Gp-9(b) is unfounded. Moreover, we argue that available information on insect OBPs (the family of proteins to which GP-9 belongs), on the evolutionary/population genetics of Gp-9, and on pheromonal/behavioral control of fire ant colony queen number fails to support their view that GP-9 plays no role in the chemosensory-mediated communication that underpins regulation of social organization. Our analyses lead us to conclude that there are no new reasons to question the existing consensus view of the Gp-9 system outlined in Gotzek and Ross (2007).},

abstract = {The last 20 years witnessed a real paradigm shift concerning the impact of biotic factors on ecosystem functions as well as on vegetation structure of mangrove forests. Before this small scientific revolution took place, structural aspects of mangrove forests were viewed to be the result of abiotic processes acting from the bottom-up, while, at ecosystem level, the outwelling hypothesis stated that mangroves primary production was removed via tidal action and carried to adjacent nearshore ecosystems where it fuelled detrital based food-webs. The sesarmid crabs were the first macrofaunal taxon to be considered a main actor in mangrove structuring processes, thanks to a number of studies carried out in the Indo-Pacific forests in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following these classical papers, a number of studies on Sesarmidae feeding and burrowing ecology were carried out, which leave no doubts about the great importance of these herbivorous crabs in structuring and functioning Old world ecosystems. Although Sesarmidae are still considered very important in shaping mangrove structure and functioning, recent literature emphasizes the significance of other invertebrates. The Ocypodidae have now been shown to have the same role as Sesarmidae in terms of retention of forest products and organic matter processing in New world mangroves. In both New and Old world mangroves, crabs process large amounts of algal primary production, contribute consistently to retention of mangrove production and as ecosystem engineers, change particle size distribution and enhance soil aeration. Our understanding of the strong impact of gastropods, by means of high intake rates of mangrove products and differential consumption of propagules, has changed only recently. The role of insects must also be stressed. It is now clear that older techniques used to assess herbivory rates by insects strongly underestimate their impact, both in case of leaf eating and wood boring species and that herbivorous insects can potentially play a strong role in many aspects of mangrove ecology. Moreover, researchers only recently realized that ant-plant interactions may form an important contribution to our understanding of insect-plant dynamics in these habitats. Ants seem to be able to relieve mangroves from important herbivores such as many insects and sesarmid crabs. It thus seems likely that ants have positive effects on mangrove performance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Habitat loss is widely used as a measurement of the risk of extinction, but because many coastal species are migratory, the impact of habitat loss will depend not only on its extent, but also on where it occurs. Here, we develop a novel graph-theoretic approach to measure the vulnerability of a migratory network to the impact of habitat loss from SLR based on population flow through the network. We show that reductions in population flow far exceed the proportion of habitat lost for 10 long-distance migrant shorebirds using the East Asian–Australasian Flyway. We estimate that SLR will inundate 23–40{\%} of intertidal habitat area along their migration routes, but cause a reduction in population flow of up to 72 per cent across the taxa. This magnifying effect was particularly strong for taxa whose migration routes contain bottlenecks—sites through which a large fraction of the population travels. We develop the bottleneck index, a new network metric that positively correlates with the predicted impacts of habitat loss on overall population flow. Our results indicate that migratory species are at greater risk than previously realized.},

abstract = {The complete mitochondrial genome and a set of polymorphic microsatellite markers were identified by 454 pyrosequencing (1/16th of a plate) for the New Cale-donian rainforest spider-ant Leptomyrmex pallens. De novo genome assembly recovered the entire mitochondrial gen-ome with mean coverage of 8.9-fold (range 1–27). The mitogenome consists of 15,591 base pairs including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal subunit genes, 22 transfer RNAs, and a non-coding AT-rich region. The genome arrangement is typical of insect taxa and very similar to the only other published ant mitogenome from the Solenopsis genus, with the main differences consisting of translocations and inversions of tRNAs. A total of 13 polymorphic loci were also characterized using 41 indi-viduals from a single population in the Aoupini{\'{e}} region, corresponding to workers from 21 nests and 16 foraging workers. We observed moderate genetic variation across most loci (mean number of alleles per locus = 4.50; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.53) with evidence of only two loci deviating significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium due to null alleles. Marker independence was confirmed with tests for linkage disequilibrium. Most loci cross amplified for three additional Leptomyrmex species. The annotation of the mitogenome and characterization of microsatellite markers will provide useful tools for assessing the colony structure, population genetic patterns, and dispersal strategy of L. pallens in the context of rain-forest fragmentation in New Caledonia. Furthermore, this paper confirms a recent line of evidence that comprehen-sive mitochondrial data can be obtained relatively easily from small next-generation sequencing analyses. Greater synthesis of next-generation sequencing data will play a significant role in expanding the taxonomic representation of mitochondrial genome sequences.},

abstract = {We tested if fragmentation alters ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) composition, through the similarity of species composition within the remnants with matrix habitat. We sampled 17 tropical forest remnants and adjoined grassland matrix. Species composition was altered by fragmentation, because although total species richness increased with remnant area, the proportion of generalist ant species (occurring both in the matrix and in the forest) decreased. Four mechanisms may explain the above patterns: (i) fragmentation changed conditions inside the remnants, favoring species formerly only present in forest gaps; (ii) isolation effects changed the pool of species able to colonize different remnants; (iii) fragmentation increased invasion by generalist species, through the increase in perimeter/area ratio and conditions more similar to matrix habitats; and (iv) area reduction is higher than perimeter reduction. Smaller remnants lose more species than larger ones and receive less species from the matrix than large remnants, which explains the patterns found.},

An enrichment step is often necessary but not always straightforward depending on the initial DNA quality or quantity. Furthermore, the availability of close mitochondrial DNA reference sequences for non-model species limits the primer design for long-range PCR or bait synthesis. Here we propose an easy and cost-effective protocol without enrichment step for building and sequencing multiplexed Illumina libraries from small quantities of either high-quality or degraded genomic DNA. We validated the approach through the successful assembly of the complete mitogenome of 60 bats and 7 tunicates. Our protocol allows the sequencing and assembly of mitochondrial genomes from non-model species with sufficient coverage for applications in conservation genetics.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been a marker of choice for reconstructing historical patterns of population demography, admixture, biogeography and speciation. However, it has recently been suggested that the pervasive nature of direct and indirect selection on this molecule renders any conclusion derived from it ambiguous. We review here the evidence for indirect selection on mtDNA in arthropods arising from linkage disequilibrium with maternally inherited symbionts. We note first that these symbionts are very common in arthropods and then review studies that reveal the extent to which they shape mtDNA evolution. mtDNA diversity patterns are compatible with neutral expectations for an uninfected population in only 2 of 19 cases. The remaining 17 studies revealed cases of symbiont-driven reduction in mtDNA diversity, symbiont-driven increases in diversity, symbiont-driven changes in mtDNA variation over space and symbiont-associated paraphyly of mtDNA. We therefore conclude that these elements often confound the inference of an organism's evolutionary history from mtDNA data and that mtDNA on its own is an unsuitable marker for the study of recent historical events in arthropods. We also discuss the impact of these studies on the current programme of taxonomy based on DNA bar-coding.},

Some sacoglossan sea slugs sequester functional plastids (kleptoplasts) from their food, which continue to fix CO 2 in a light dependent manner inside the animals. In plants and algae, plastid and mitochondrial metabolism are linked in ways that reach beyond the provision of energy-rich carbon compounds through photosynthesis, but how slug mitochondria respond to starvation or alterations in plastid biochemistry has not been explored. We assembled the mitochondrial genomes of the plastid-sequestering sea slugs Elysia timida and Elysia cornigera from RNA-Seq data that was complemented with standard sequencing of mitochondrial DNA through primer walking. Our data confirm the sister species relationship of the two Sacoglossa and from the analysis of changes in mitochondrial-associated metabolism during starvation we speculate that kleptoplasts might aid in the rerouting or recycling of reducing power independent of, yet maybe improved by, photosynthesis.},

abstract = {In species living in seasonally variable environments, the ability to synchronize the timing of breeding with the peak of critical resources is under positive selection within populations. The temporal scheduling of animal annual cycle is controlled by endogenous rhythms, which are set by ‘circadian clock' genes. Many studies have supported the hypothesis that length polymorphism in some ‘phenological genes' is associated with differences in the photoperiodic responses among individ- uals and populations. However, evidence is inconsistent across species, genes and phenological traits. Among birds, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the gene-phenotype association in non-migratory species. To contribute filling this gap, here we analyzed clutch initiation date of females of a species resident at temperate latitudes, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), in relation to the length poly- morphism at four loci previously associated with breeding and migration phenology in other species: Adcyap1 and Npas2 genes, as well as two regions of the Clock gene. Although polymorphism was observed at three loci, allele size of the candi- date genes seems not to predict the timing of breeding in females. In addition, similar genotype frequencies of all the analyzed genes were observed in early com- pared to late breeding females. Our results therefore suggest that the associations between photoperiodic candidate genes and breeding phenotype are not general across species and might represent adaptations of individual populations to the local environment.},

abstract = {Mammals have extremely limited regenerative capabilities; however, axolotls are profoundly regenerative and can replace entire limbs. The mechanisms underlying limb regeneration remain poorly understood, partly because the enormous and incompletely sequenced genomes of axolotls have hindered the study of genes facilitating regeneration. We assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome using RNA-sequencing profiles for a broad spectrum of tissues that is estimated to have near-complete sequence information for 88{\%} of axolotl genes. We devised expression analyses that identified the axolotl orthologs of cirbp and kazald1 as highly expressed and enriched in blastemas.

abstract = {An accurate understanding of species diversity is essential to studies across a wide range of biological subdisciplines. However, delimiting species remains challenging in evolutionary radiations where morphological diversification is rapid and accompanied by little genetic differentiation or when genetic lineage divergence is not accompanied by morphological change. We investigate the utility of a variety of recently developed approaches to examine genetic and morphological diversity, and delimit species in a morphologically conserved group of Southeast Asian lizards. We find that species diversity is vastly underestimated in this unique evolutionary radiation, and find an extreme case where extensive genetic divergence among lineages has been accompanied by little to no differentiation in external morphology. Although we note that different conclusions can be drawn when species are delimited using molecular phylogenetics, coalescent-based methods, or morphological data, it is clear that the use of a pluralistic approach leads to a more comprehensive appraisal of biodiversity, and greater appreciation for processes of diversification in this biologically important geographic region. Similarly, our approach demonstrates how recently developed methodologies can be used to obtain robust estimates of species limits in "nonadaptive" or "cryptic" evolutionary radiations. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

Three species (Odontoponera transversa, Pachycondyla indica, and Pachycondyla obscuricornis) contained a mixture of alkylpyrazines and oxygenated compounds and some simple terpenes; and the remaining two (Diacamma vagans and a Diacamma sp. from India) had only oxygenated compounds present. The two Diacamma species were notable in containing a dioxaspiro-undecane (a spiroketal), not hitherto found in ants. All the 33 known mandibular gland analyses of workers of ponerine ant species have been brought together in order to seek some pattern in the type of glandular contents.

The genetic proximity among the W. auropunctata populations from cocoa (14.1{\%}) and coconut plantations (18.5{\%}) in Ilh{\'{e}}us with the populations from the French Guyanan forests suggest that there was recent and large expansion of populations derived from a single population, that are today distributed in habitats with similar environmental characteristics.

abstract = {The basal actinopterygians comprise four major lineages (polypteriforms, acipenseriforms, lepisosteids, and Amia) and have been collectively called "ancient fish." We investigated the phylogeny of this group of fishes in relation to teleosts using mitochondrial genomic (mitogenomic) data, and compared this to the various alternative phylogenetic hypotheses that have been proposed previously. In addition to the previously determined complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 14 teleosts and two outgroups, we used newly determined mitogenomic sequences of 12 purposefully chosen species representing all the ancient fish lineages plus related teleosts. This data set comprised concatenated nucleotide sequences from 12 protein-coding genes (excluding the ND6 gene and third codon positions) and 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (stem regions only) and these data were subjected to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses. The resultant trees from the three methods were well resolved and largely congruent, with most internal branches being supported by high statistical values. Mitogenomic data strongly supported not only the monophyly of the teleosts (osteoglossomorphs and above), but also a sister-group relationship between the teleosts and a clade comprising the acipenseriforms, lepisosteids, and Amia, with the polypteriforms occupying the most basal position in the actinopterygian phylogeny. Although the tree topology di8ered from any of the previously proposed hypotheses based on morphology, it exhibited congruence with a recently proposed novel hypothesis based on nuclear markers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Despite near universal recognition of its importance, major barriers still exist to sharing raw data, software, and research products throughout the scientific community. Many of these barriers vary by specialty [1], increasing the difficulties for interdisciplinary and/or translational researchers to engage in collaborative research. Multi-site collaborations are vital for increasing both the impact and the generalizability of research results. However, they often present unique data sharing challenges. We discuss enabling multi-site collaborations through enhanced data sharing in this set of Ten Simple Rules. Collaboration is an essential component of research [2] that takes many forms, including internal (across departments within a single institution) and external collaborations (across institutions). However, multi-site collaborations with more than two institutions encounter more complex challenges because of institutional-specific restrictions and guidelines [3]. Vicens and Bourne focus on collaborators working together on a shared research grant [4]. They do not discuss the specific complexities of multi-site collaborations and the vital need for enhanced data sharing in the multi-site and large-scale collaboration context, in which partici-pants may or may not have the same funding source and/or research grant. While challenging, multi-site collaborations are equally rewarding and result in increased research productivity [5, 6]. One highly successful multi-site and translational collaboration is the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network (URL: https://emerge.mc.},

Divergence dates, historical biogeography, {\&} the origin of reproduction by gamergate workers were estimated on the inferred phylogeny. The most important results of this study include: (1) the monophyly of Ponerinae; (2) the paraphyly of Ponerini; (3) the extensive non-monophyly of Pachycondyla; (4) a rapid basal radiation in Ponerini; (5) resolution of many deeper relationships within Ponerini; (6) a rapid {\&} rich basal radiation in the Odontomachus group; (7) an origin for Ponerinae in the upper Cretaceous, with a major burst of diversification near the K/T boundary; (8) a history of rich {\&} continual ponerine diversification during the Cenozoic; (9) a history of regionalized radiations {\&} frequent faunal exchange between major biogeographic provinces; {\&} (10) support for multiple origins of gamergates in Ponerinae. Ponerine taxonomic classification is revised to reflect both these phylogenetic results {\&} a re-appraisal of ponerine morphological diversity. The monogeneric tribe Thaumatomyrmecini is newly synonymized under Ponerini, {\&} the diverse genus Pachycondyla is fragmented into 15 genera, largely along the lines of its junior synonyms, though 2 new genera are erected: Buniapone (gen.nov.) {\&} Mayaponera (gen.nov.). Some junior synonyms of Pachycondyla are transferred to junior synonym status under other genera: Wadeura as a junior synonym of Cryptopone (syn.nov.), Xiphopelta as a junior synonym of Pseudoponera (syn.nov.), {\&} both Termitopone {\&} Syntermitopone as junior synonyms of Neoponera (syn.nov.). Molecular {\&} morphological justifications for these taxonomic changes are given alongside discussions of phylogenetic relationships.

Since then, this species has also been recorded in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. We compiled and mapped published and unpublished specimen records of P. obscurithorax from {\textgreater}170 sites in South America and the US to evaluate the current geographic range of this species and its possible future spread. We documented the earliest known records for nine geographic areas (South American countries and US states). Site records of P. obscurithorax ranged 27.5 degrees of latitude (from 6.7°S to 34.2°S) in South America, and 3.5 degrees of latitude (from 28.0°N to 31.5°N) in North America. It may be that the North American populations of P. obscurithorax have a fairly narrow range of climatic tolerances. Earlier genetic analyses of native and exotic populations of P. obscurithorax found that the North America populations appear to originate from a single introduction from a population most closely related to native study populations from a stretch along the Paran{\'{a}} River in Argentina from Resistencia (27.5°S) to Santa Fe (31.6°S). This latitudinal range matches the current latitudinal range of P. obscurithorax in North America. Alternatively, the much greater latitudinal range of P. obscurithorax in South America suggests that exotic populations of P. obscurithorax may have potential for much additional expansion in North America and beyond. In South America, P. obscurithorax has a similar native range as the invasive fire ant Solenopsis invicta . In the North America, exotic populations of P. obscurithorax may spread like S. invicta has, across the southeast of the US and into the West Indies},

His work was a landmark treatment of the European fauna and laid the groundwork for subsequent mammalogists. Miller's impressive body of specimen-based research underscores the fundamental role natural history collections have played in building our understanding of the natural world. Their relevance to basic discovery endures, as collections have evolved since Miller's time to include new materials (e.g., tissues, cell suspensions, linked host/parasites), and as new tools (e.g., genomic sequencing, stable isotopes, niche envelopes) for extracting information have developed exponentially. While still utilized for systematic and taxonomic questions, museums and associated web-based databases (GBIF, GenBank, GoogleEarth) are now critical to our ability to rigorously address questions related to environmental change (e.g., climate change, habitat conversion, emerging pathogens, pollutants and toxicants, biodiversity loss, introduction of exotics). Specimens are the primary resource that objectively documents diversity and vouchers historic conditions. By representing a particular site and time, georeferenced specimens establish critical baseline conditions against which temporal change can be investigated. As in Miller's day, museums remain centers for research and training as future generations of scientists are introduced to biodiversity studies.},

Furthermore, we also connected Pfam entries to the Sequence Ontology (SO) through mapping of the Pfam type definitions to SO terms. Since Pfam has many community contributors, we recently enabled the linking between authorship of all Pfam entries with the corresponding authors- ORCID identifiers. This effectively permits authors to claim credit for their Pfam curation and link them to their ORCID record.},

Using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis we show that Catoptrophorus and Heteroscelus are embedded within Tringa, and thus these genera should be merged in Tringa. Phylogenetic analyses of 18 morphological characters resulted in a partly resolved tree, so we mapped them on the molecular phylogeny and reconstructed ancestral states by maximum likelihood. Twelve of the morphological characters are homoplastic or plesiomorphic, and only six are phylogenetically informative, placing Xenus and Actitis outside the remaining genera. The bright yellow and red leg coloration of yellowlegs and redshanks are, respectively, a retained ancestral state and a parallel acquisition. Using a semi-parametric penalized-likelihood approach to correct for rate variation among lineages we estimated that speciation occurred in the Early Miocene-Pliocene.},

Hence, constructing and updating species lists provides vital information about species distribution records. The Sustainable Amazon Network (in Portuguese Rede Amaz{\^{o}}nia Sustent{\'{a}}vel; RAS) is an interdisciplinary research initiative that aims to evaluate land-cover changes effects in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Within the scope of this project, we sampled ants and orchid bees and herein present a list of species collected in Paragominas, PA, Brazil; the most complete lists of species published to date of these groups for the eastern Amazon. We sampled these insects across several land-cover types, from undisturbed primary forest, through varyingly disturbed primary and secondary forests to production areas (silviculture, pastures and arable fields). In total we recorded 285 species of ants and 36 species of orchid bees. Species richness was higher in primary forests for both groups, followed by production areas. Orchid bees reached their highest richness in secondary forests. For orchid bees, production areas were dominated by a few hyper-dominant species, such as Eulaema nigrita. We acknowledge that the use of different sampling methods would collect additional species, and we recommend this for future assessments if the aim is to make a complete inventory. We expect this study can be used as a baseline for understanding the effectiveness of ongoing changes in forest conservation and land management practices. Finally, this list is of suitable importance in determining conservation status for several taxa described here.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The reconstruction of evolutionary trees from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data is a common tool with which to infer the relationships of living organisms. The wide use of mtDNA stems from the ease of getting new sequence data for a set of orthologus genes and from the availability of many existing mtDNA sequences for a wide array of species. In this review we argue that developing a fuller understanding of the biology of mitochondria is essential for the rigorous application of mtDNA to inferences about the evolutionary history of species or populations. Though much progress has been made in understanding the parameters that shape the evolution of mitochondria and mtDNA, many questions still remain, and a better understanding of the role this organelle plays in regulating organismal fitness is becoming increasingly critical for accurate phylogeny reconstruction. In population biology, the limited information content of one nonrecombining genetic marker can compromise evolutionary inference, and the effects of nuclear genetic variation—and environmental factors—in mtDNA fitness differences can compound these problems. In systematics, the limited gene set, biased amino acid composition, and problems of compensatory substitutions can cloud phylogenetic signal. Dissecting the functional bases of these biases offers both challenges and opportunities in comparative biology.},

Wide crown and stem age differences between the ant-housing genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) and its obligate ant inhabitants, and stochastic trait mapping, indicate that its domatium evolved earlier than the ants now occupying it, suggesting previous symbioses that dissolved. Parasitic ant species evolved from generalists, not from mutualists, and are younger than the mutualistic systems they parasitize. Our study illuminates the macroevolutionary assem- bly of ant/plant symbioses, which has been highly dynamic, even in very specialized systems.},

abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products corresponding to 803 bp of the cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA COI-II) were deduced to consist of multiple haplotypes in three Sitobion species. We investigated the molecular basis of these observations. PCR products were cloned, and six clones from one individual per species were sequenced. In each individual, one sequence was found commonly, but also two or three divergent sequences were seen. The divergent sequences were shown to be nonmitochondrial by sequencing from purified mtDNA and Southern blotting experiments. All seven nonmitochondrial clones sequenced to completion were unique. Nonmitochondrial sequences have a high proportion of unique sites, and very few characters are shared between nonmitochondrial clones to the exclusion of mtDNA. From these data, we infer that fragments of mtDNA have been transposed separately (probably into aphid chromosomes), at a frequency only known to be equalled in humans. The transposition phenomenon appears to occur infrequently or not at all in closely related genera and other aphids investigated. Patterns of nucleotide substitution in mtDNA inferred over a parsimony tree are very different from those in transposed sequences. Compared with mtDNA, nonmitochondrial sequences have less codon position bias, more even exchanges between A, G, C and T, and a higher proportion of nonsynonymous replacements. Although these data are consistent with the transposed sequences being under less constraint than mtDNA, changes in the nonmitochondrial sequences are not random: there remains significant position bias, and probable excesses of synonymous replacements and of conservative inferred amino acid replacements. We conclude that a proportion of the inferred change in the nonmitochondrial sequences occurred before transposition. We believe that Sitobion aphids (and other species exhibiting mtDNA transposition) may be important for studying the molecular evolution of mtDNA and pseudogenes. However, our data highlight the need to establish the true evolutionary relationships between sequences in comparative investigations.},

abstract = {Diversity among assemblages of mammalian hosts and parasites in northern terrestrial ecosystems was structured by a deep history of biotic and abiotic change that overlies a complex geographic arena. Since the Pliocene, Holarctic ecosystems assembled in response to shifting climates (glacial and interglacial stages). Cycles of episodic dispersal/isolation and diversification defined northern diversity on landscape to regional scales. Episodes of geographic expansion and colonisation linked Eurasia and North America across Beringia and drove macroevolutionary structure of host and parasite associations. Asynchronous dispersal from centres of origin in Eurasia into the Nearctic resulted in gradients in parasite diversity in the carnivoran, lagomorph, rodent and artiodactyl assemblages we reviewed. Recurrent faunal interchange and isolation in conjunction with episodes of host colonisation have produced a mosaic structure for parasite faunas and considerable cryptic diversity among nematodes and cestodes. Mechanisms of invasion and geographic colonisation leading to the establishment of complex faunal assemblages are equivalent in evolutionary and ecological time, as demonstrated by various explorations of diversity in these high-latitude systems. Our ability to determine historical responses to episodic shifts in global climate may provide a framework for predicting the cascading effects of contemporary environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Order Charadriiformes (shorebirds) is an ideal model group in which to study a wide range of behavioural, ecological and macroevolutionary processes across species. However, comparative studies depend on phylogeny to control for the effects of shared evolutionary history. Although numerous hypotheses have been presented for subsets of the Charadriiformes none to date include all recognised species. Here we use the matrix representation with parsimony method to produce the first fully inclusive supertree of Charadriiformes. We also provide preliminary estimates of ages for all nodes in the tree. RESULTS: Three main lineages are revealed: i) the plovers and allies; ii) the gulls and allies; and iii) the sandpipers and allies. The relative position of these clades is unresolved in the strict consensus tree but a 50{\%} majority-rule consensus tree indicates that the sandpiper clade is sister group to the gulls and allies whilst the plover group is placed at the base of the tree. The overall topology is highly consistent with recent molecular hypotheses of shorebird phylogeny. CONCLUSION: The supertree hypothesis presented herein is (to our knowledge) the only complete phylogenetic hypothesis of all extant shorebirds. Despite concerns over the robustness of supertrees (see Discussion), we believe that it provides a valuable framework for testing numerous evolutionary hypotheses relating to the diversity of behaviour, ecology and life-history of the Charadriiformes.},

abstract = {Previously the province of large genome centres, DNA sequencing is now a key component of research carried out in many laboratories. A number of new applica-tions of sequencing technologies have been spurred by rapidly decreasing costs, including the study of microbial communities (metagenomics), the discovery of structural variants in genomes and the analysis of gene structure and expression. The length of the sequences generated by modern sequencing instru-ments is considerably shorter (hundreds to thousands of base pairs) than that of the genomes or genomic features being studied (which commonly span tens of thousands to billions of base pairs). Thus, many analyses start with the computational process of sequence assembly that joins together the many sequence fragments generated by the instrument. Biologists who need to assemble the sequencing data generated in their experiments are faced with the challenge of choosing, from a myriad of options, the assembly strategy and software best suited for their experiment. This choice is made harder by the rapid development of new assembly tools, which is driven by advances in sequencing technologies and the broader scope of applications for these technolo-gies. Among recent innovations in sequence assem-bly are the use of memory-efficient data structures},

abstract = {Prolonged unaccustomed exercise involving muscle lengthening (eccentric) actions can result in ultrastructural muscle disruption, impaired excitation-contraction coupling, inflammation and muscle protein degradation. This process is associated with delayed onset muscle soreness and is referred to as exercise-induced muscle damage. Although a certain amount of muscle damage may be necessary for adaptation to occur, excessive damage or inadequate recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage can increase injury risk, particularly in older individuals, who experience more damage and require longer to recover from muscle damaging exercise than younger adults. Furthermore, it is apparent that inter-individual variation exists in the response to exercise-induced muscle damage, and there is evidence that genetic variability may play a key role. Although this area of research is in its infancy, certain gene variations, or polymorphisms have been associated with exercise-induced muscle damage (i.e. individuals with certain genotypes experience greater muscle damage, and require longer recovery, following strenuous exercise). These polymorphisms include ACTN3 (R577X, rs1815739), TNF (-308 G{\textgreater}A, rs1800629), IL6 (-174 G{\textgreater}C, rs1800795), and IGF2 (ApaI, 17200 G{\textgreater}A, rs680). Knowing how someone is likely to respond to a particular type of exercise could help coaches/practitioners individualise the exercise training of their athletes/patients, thus maximising recovery and adaptation, while reducing overload-associated injury risk. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical analysis of the literature concerning gene polymorphisms associated with exercise-induced muscle damage, both in young and older individuals, and to highlight the potential mechanisms underpinning these associations, thus providing a better understanding of exercise-induced muscle damage.},

abstract = {Intraspecific variability in social organization is common, yet the underlying causes are rarely known. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a single Mendelian genomic element marked by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene. Here we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social polymorphism, and show that it is part of a pair of heteromorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approximately 13 megabases (55{\%} of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9 megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination.},

The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4–11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5–7]. We used ultraconserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from {\textgreater}800 UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference.},

abstract = {The House Crow (Corvus splendens) is a useful study system for investigating the genetic basis of adaptations underpinning successful range expansion. The species originates from the Indian subcontinent, but has successfully spread through a variety of thermal environments across Asia, Africa and Europe. Here, population mitogenomics was used to investigate the colonisation history and to test for signals of molecular selection on the mitochondrial genome. We sequenced the mitogenomes of 89 House Crows spanning four native and five invasive populations. A Bayesian dated phylogeny, based on the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, supports a mid-Pleistocene ({\~{}}630,000 years ago) divergence between the most distant genetic lineages. Phylogeographic patterns suggest that northern South Asia is the likely centre of origin for the species. Codon-based analyses of selection and assessments of changes in amino acid properties provide evidence of positive selection on the ND2 and ND5 genes against a background of purifying selection across the mitogenome. Protein homology modelling suggests that four amino acid substitutions inferred to be under positive selection may modulate coupling efficiency and proton translocation mediated by OXPHOS complex I. The identified substitutions are found within native House Crow lineages and ecological niche modelling predicts suitable climatic areas for the establishment of crow populations within the invasive range. Mitogenomic patterns in the invasive range of the species are more strongly associated with introduction history than climate. We speculate that invasions of the House Crow have been facilitated by standing genetic variation that accumulated due to diversifying selection within the native range.},

abstract = {The advent of Next Generation Sequencing has reduced sequencing costs and increased genomic projects from a huge amount of organismal taxa, generating an unprecedented amount of genomic datasets publicly available. Often, only a tiny fraction of outstanding relevance of the genomic data produced by researchers is used in their works. This fact allows the data generated to be recycled in further projects worldwide. The assembly of complete mitogenomes is frequently overlooked though it is useful to understand evolutionary relationships among taxa, especially those presenting poor mtDNA sampling at the level of genera and families. This is exactly the case for ants (Hymenoptera:Formicidae) and more specifically for the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae, a group of arboreal ants with several cases of convergent coevolution without any complete mitochondrial sequence available. In this work, we assembled, annotated and performed comparative genomics analyses of 14 new complete mitochondria from Pseudomyrmecinae species relying solely on public datasets available from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We used all complete mitogenomes available for ants to study the gene order conservation and also to generate two phylogenetic trees using both (i) concatenated set of 13 mitochondrial genes and (ii) the whole mitochondrial sequences. Even though the tree topologies diverged subtly from each other (and from previous studies), our results confirm several known relationships and generate new evidences for sister clade classification inside Pseudomyrmecinae clade. We also performed a synteny analysis for Formicidae and identified possible sites in which nucleotidic insertions happened in mitogenomes of pseudomyrmecine ants. Using a data mining/bioinformatics approach, the current work increased the number of complete mitochondrial genomes available for ants from 15 to 29, demonstrating the unique potential of public databases for mitogenomics studies. The wide applications of mitogenomes in research and presence of mitochondrial data in different public dataset types makes the “no budget mitogenomics” approach ideal for comprehensive molecular studies, especially for subsampled taxa.},

One way to study proteins from such secretions is by RNA-seq; a powerful molecular tool to characterize the transcriptome of such specialized gland, and its protein secretions. The total RNA from venom gland tissues of H. horridum horridum was extracted and a cDNA library was constructed and sequenced. Overall, 114,172 transcripts were found, and 199 were annotated based on sequence similarities to previously described peptides/proteins. Transcripts coding for putative exendins, defensins, natriuretics and serine protease inhibitors were the most highly expressed. Transcripts that code for several putative serine proteases, phospholipases, metalloproteases, lipases, L-amino oxidase and nucleases were also found. Some of the novel identified transcripts were translationally controlled tumor proteins, venom factors, vespryns, waprins, lectins, cystatins and serine protease inhibitors.

abstract = {Insect mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) are usually double helical and circular molecules containing 37 genes that are encoded on both strands. The arrangement of the genes is not constant for all species, and produces distinct gene orders (GOs) that have proven to be diagnostic in defining clades at different taxonomic levels. In general, it is believed that distinct taxa have a very low chance of sharing identically arranged GOs. However, examples of identical, homoplastic local rearrangements occurring in distinct taxa do exist. In this study, we sequenced the complete mtDNAs of the ants Formica fusca and Myrmica scabrinodis (Formicidae, Hymenoptera) and compared their GOs with those of other Insecta. The GO of F. fusca was found to be identical to the GO of Dytrisia (the largest clade of Lepidoptera). This finding is the first documented case of an identical GO shared by distinct groups of Insecta, and it is the oldest known event of GO convergent evolution in animals. Both Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera acquired this GO early in their evolution. Using a phylogenetic approach combined with new bioinformatic tools, the chronological order of the evolutionary events that produced the diversity of the hymenopteran GOs was determined. Additionally, new local homoplastic rearrangements shared by distinct groups of insects were identified. Our study showed that local and global homoplasies affecting the insect GOs are more widespread than previously thought. Homoplastic GOs can still be useful for characterizing the various clades, provided that they are appropriately considered in a phylogenetic and taxonomic context.},

abstract = {The ants in the subfamily Amblyoponinae are an old, relictual group with an unusual suite of morphological and behavioural features. Adult workers pierce the integument of their larvae to imbibe haemolymph, earning them the vernacular name ‘dracula ants'. We investigate the phylogeny of this group with a data set based on 54 ingroup taxa, 23 outgroups and 11 nuclear gene fragments (7.4 kb). We find that the genus Opamyrma has been misplaced in this subfamily: it is a member of the leptanilline clade and sister to all other extant Leptanillinae. Transfer of Opamyrma to Leptanillinae renders the Amblyoponinae monophyletic. The enigmatic Afrotropical genus Apomyrma is sister to all other amblyoponines, and the latter cleave into two distinct and well-supported clades, here termed POA and XMMAS. The POA clade, containing Prionopelta, Onychomyrmex and Amblyopone, is well resolved internally, and its structure supports synonymy of the genus Concoctio under Prionopelta (syn.n.). The XMMAS clade comprises two well-supported groups: (i) a predominantly Neotropical clade, for which we resurrect the genus name Fulakora (stat.r., stat.n.), with junior synonyms Paraprionopelta (syn.n.) and Ericapelta (syn.n.); and (ii) the remaining taxa, or ‘core XMMAS', which are manifested in our study as a poorly resolved bush of about a dozen lineages, suggesting rapid radiation at the time of their origin. Most of these XMMAS lineages have been assigned to the catch-all genus Stigmatomma, but the more distinctive elements have been treated as separate genera (Xymmer, Mystrium, Myopopone and Adetomyrma). Resolution of basal relationships in the core XMMAS clade and reconfiguration of ‘Stigmatomma' to restore monophyly of all named genera will require more extensive genetic data and additional morphological analysis. However, the genus Bannapone can be synonymized under Stigmatomma (syn.n.) because it is embedded within a clade that contains S. denticulatum, the type species of Stigmatomma. Divergence dating analysis indicates that crown Amblyoponinae arose in the mid-Cretaceous, about 107 Ma (95{\%} highest probability density: 93–121 Ma). The POA and XMMAS clades have estimated crown ages of 47 and 73 Ma, respectively. The initial burst of diversification in the core XMMAS clade occurred in the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene (50–60 Ma). Ancestral range reconstruction suggests that amblyoponines originated in the Afrotropics, and dispersed to the Indo-Malayan region and to the New World. During none of these dispersal events did the ants break out of their cryptobiotic lifestyle.},

abstract = {Abstract Processes acting on different spatial and temporal scales may influence local species richness. Ant communities are usually described as interactive and therefore determined by local processes. In this paper we tested two hypotheses linked to the question of why there is local variation in arboreal ant species richness in the Brazilian savanna (‘cerrado'). The hypotheses are: (i) there is a positive relationship between ant species richness and tree species richness, used as a surrogate of heterogeneity; and (ii) there is a positive relationship between ant species richness and tree density, used as a surrogate of resource availability. Arboreal ants were sampled in two cerrado sites in Brazil using baited pitfall traps and manual sampling, in quadrats of 20 m × 50 m. Ant species richness in each quadrat was used as the response variable in regression tests, using tree species richness and tree density as explanatory variables. Ant species richness responded positively to tree species richness and density. Sampling site also influenced ant species richness, and the relationship between tree density and tree species richness was also positive and significant. Tree species richness may have influenced ant species richness through three processes: (i) increasing the variety of resources and allowing the existence of a higher number of specialist species; (ii) increasing the amount of resources to generalist species; and (iii) some other unmeasured factor may have influenced both ant and tree species richness. Tree density may also have influenced ant species richness through three processes: (i) increasing the amount of resources and allowing a higher ant species richness; (ii) changing habitat conditions and dominance hierarchies in ant communities; and (iii) increasing the area and causing a species–area pattern. Processes acting on larger scales, such as disturbance, altitude and evolutionary histories, as well as sampling effect may have caused the difference between sites.},

We developed robust bioinformatic pipelines that rigorously detect and filter out base misincorporations in DNA derived from skins, most of which likely resulted from postmortem damage. Furthermore, to accommodate genotyping uncertainties associated with low-medium coverage data, we applied a recently developed probabilistic method to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and estimate allele frequencies and the joint site frequency spectrum. Our results show increased genetic subdivision following range retraction, but no change in overall genetic diversity at either nonsynonymous or synonymous sites. This case study showcases the advantages of integrating emerging genomic and statistical tools in museum collection-based population genomic applications. Such technical advances greatly enhance the value of museum collections, even where a pre-existing reference is lacking and points to a broad range of potential applications in evolutionary and conservation biology.},

abstract = {Many different DNA isolation methods have been employed successfully in ants. Parameters such as the size and developmental stage of the specimen (egg, larvae, or adult) and the subsequent use of the DNA will mostly determine which method should be used. Ant body sizes range from minute (1-2 mm in length) to large (30 mm), and the volume of the initial digestion should be adjusted accordingly. Whereas workers usually have low concentrations of storage proteins and fat, queens and larvae can contain considerable amounts of these substances that can interfere with the subsequent use of the isolated DNA. Ants also have many glands in the head and abdomen, and the contents of these glands can also interfere with the successful application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or restriction digests of the isolated DNA. This protocol presents two DNA isolation methods that have worked reliably for a wide range of ant species: a "quick and dirty" technique using Chelex isolation, and a more elaborate, classical phenol:chloroform procedure.},

We sampled 17 tropical forest remnants and adjoined grassland matrix. Species composition was altered by fragmentation, because although total species richness increased with remnant area, the proportion of generalist ant species (occurring both in the matrix and in the forest) decreased. Four mechanisms may explain the above patterns: (i) fragmentation changed conditions inside the remnants, favoring species formerly only present in forest gaps; (ii) isolation effects changed the pool of species able to colonize different remnants; (iii) fragmentation increased invasion by generalist species, through the increase in perimeter/area ratio and conditions more similar to matrix habitats; and (iv) area reduction is higher than perimeter reduction. Smaller remnants lose more species than larger ones and receive less species from the matrix than large remnants, which explains the patterns found.},

abstract = {The evolutionary history of living species is usually inferred through the phylogenetic analysis of molecular and morphological information using various mathematical models. New challenges in phylogenetic analysis are centered mostly on the search for accurate and efficient methods to handle the huge amounts of sequence data generated from newer genome sequencing. The next major challenge is the determination of relationships between the evolution of structural elements and their functional implementation, which is largely ignored in previous analyses. Here, we described the discovery of structural elements in metazoan mitochondrial genomes, termed key K-strings, that can serve as a basis for phylogenetic tree construction. Although comprising only a small fraction (0.73{\%}) of all K-strings, these key K-strings are pivotal to the tree construction because they allow for a significant reduction in the computational time required to construct phylogenetic trees, and more importantly, they make significant improvement to the results of phylogenetic inference. The trees constructed from the key K-strings were consistent overall to our current view of metazoan phylogeny and exhibited a more rational topology than the trees constructed by using other conventional methods. Surprisingly, the key K-strings tended to accumulate in the conserved regions of the original sequences, which were most likely due to strong selection pressure. Furthermore, the special structural features of the key K-strings should have some potential applications in the study of the structures and functions relationship of proteins and in the determination of evolutionary trajectory of species. The novelty and potential importance of key K-strings lead us to believe that they are essential evolutionary elements. As such, they may play important roles in the process of species evolution and their physical existence. Further studies could lead to discoveries regarding the relationship between evolution and processes of speciation.},

With few exceptions, all animal mitochondrial genomes contain the same 37 genes: two for rRNAs, 13 for proteins and 22 for tRNAs. The products of these genes, along with RNAs and proteins imported from the cytoplasm, endow mitochondria with their own systems for DNA replication, transcription, mRNA processing and translation of proteins. The study of these genomes as they function in mitochondrial systems-'mitochondrial genomics'-serves as a model for genome evolution. Furthermore, the comparison of animal mitochondrial gene arrangements has become a very powerful means for inferring ancient evolutionary relationships, since rearrangements appear to be unique, generally rare events that are unlikely to arise independently in separate evolutionary lineages. Complete mitochondrial gene arrangements have been published for 58 chordate species and 29 non-chordate species, and partial arrangements for hundreds of other taxa. This review compares and summarizes these gene arrangements and points out some of the questions that may be addressed by comparing mitochondrial systems.},

In this study, we present the complete mitogenome of the atlas moth, Attacus atlas (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae), a well-known silk-producing and ornamental insect with the largest wing surface area of all moths. The mitogenome of A. atlas is a circular molecule of 15,282. bp long, and its nucleotide composition shows heavily biased towards As and Ts, accounting for 79.30{\%}. This genome comprises 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and an A. +. T-rich region. It is of note that this genome exhibits a slightly positive AT skew, which is different from the other known Saturniidae species. All PCGs are initiated by ATN codons, except for COI with CGA instead. Only six PCGs use a common stop codon of TAA or TAG, whereas the remaining seven use an incomplete termination codon T or TA. All tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structure, with an exception for tRNASer(AGN). The A. atlas A. +. T-rich region contains non-repetitive sequences, but harbors several features common to the Bombycoidea insects. The phylogenetic relationships based on Maximum Likelihood method provide a well-supported outline of Saturniidae, which is in accordance with the traditional morphological classification and recent molecular works. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Outside Asia, all records of C. biroi come from islands, possibly due to reduced competition with dominant ants in island habitats. Perhaps the many dominant native and exotic ant species in continental regions have prevented widespread establishment of C. biroi.},

This genetic factor influences the reproductive phenotypes and behavioral strategies of queens and determines whether workers tolerate a single fertile queen or multiple queens per colony. Furthermore, this factor affects worker tolerance of queens with alternate genotypes, thus explaining the dramatic differences in Gp-9 allele frequencies observed between the two social forms in the wild.

To rectify this, the International Barcode of Life Project was launched with the intent to extend the geographic and taxonomic coverage of the barcode reference library. South Africa committed to this mission in an attempt to catalogue all of its known biodiversity and, possibly, help identify new species.

abstract = {Primates, the mammalian order including our own species, comprise 480 species in 78 genera. Thus, they represent the third largest of the 18 orders of eutherian mammals. Although recent phylogenetic studies on primates are increasingly built on molecular datasets, most of these studies have focused on taxonomic subgroups within the order. Complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes have proven to be extremely useful in deciphering within-order relationships even up to deep nodes. Using 454 sequencing, we sequenced 32 new complete mt genomes adding 20 previously not represented genera to the phylogenetic reconstruction of the primate tree. With 13 new sequences, the number of complete mt genomes within the parvorder Platyrrhini was widely extended, resulting in a largely resolved branching pattern among New World monkey families. We added 10 new Strepsirrhini mt genomes to the 15 previously available ones, thus almost doubling the number of mt genomes within this clade. Our data allow precise date estimates of all nodes and offer new insights into primate evolution. One major result is a relatively young date for the most recent common ancestor of all living primates which was estimated to 66-69 million years ago, suggesting that the divergence of extant primates started close to the K/T-boundary. Although some relationships remain unclear, the large number of mt genomes used allowed us to reconstruct a robust primate phylogeny which is largely in agreement with previous publications. Finally, we show that mt genomes are a useful tool for resolving primate phylogenetic relationships on various taxonomic levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 Finstermeier et al.},

Recent developments in genomic techniques, including next generation sequencing, whole genome scans and gene-expression pattern analysis, have made it possible to step up from a limited number of neutral markers to genome-wide estimates of functional genetic variation.

A number of new applica-tions of sequencing technologies have been spurred by rapidly decreasing costs, including the study of microbial communities (metagenomics), the discovery of structural variants in genomes and the analysis of gene structure and expression. The length of the sequences generated by modern sequencing instru-ments is considerably shorter (hundreds to thousands of base pairs) than that of the genomes or genomic features being studied (which commonly span tens of thousands to billions of base pairs). Thus, many analyses start with the computational process of sequence assembly that joins together the many sequence fragments generated by the instrument. Biologists who need to assemble the sequencing data generated in their experiments are faced with the challenge of choosing, from a myriad of options, the assembly strategy and software best suited for their experiment. This choice is made harder by the rapid development of new assembly tools, which is driven by advances in sequencing technologies and the broader scope of applications for these technolo-gies. Among recent innovations in sequence assem-bly are the use of memory-efficient data structures},

Existing approaches either lack functional annotation of the identified orthologous groups, hampering the interpretation of subsequent results, or are manually annotated and thus lag behind the rapid sequencing of new genomes. Here we present the eggNOG database ('evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups'), which contains orthologous groups constructed from Smith-Waterman alignments through identification of reciprocal best matches and triangular linkage clustering. Applying this procedure to 312 bacterial, 26 archaeal and 35 eukaryotic genomes yielded 43 582 course-grained orthologous groups of which 9724 are extended versions of those from the original COG/KOG database. We also constructed more fine-grained groups for selected subsets of organisms, such as the 19 914 mammalian orthologous groups. We automatically annotated our non-supervised orthologous groups with functional descriptions, which were derived by identifying common denominators for the genes based on their individual textual descriptions, annotated functional categories, and predicted protein domains. The orthologous groups in eggNOG contain 1 241 751 genes and provide at least a broad functional description for 77{\%} of them.

abstract = {The higher termites (Termitidae) are keystone species and ecosystem engineers. They have exceptional biomass and play important roles in decomposition of dead plant matter, in soil manipulation, and as the primary food for many animals, especially in the tropics. Higher termites are most diverse in rainforests, with estimated origins in the late Eocene (∼54 Ma), postdating the breakup of Pangaea and Gondwana when most continents became separated. Since termites are poor fliers, their origin and spread across the globe requires alternative explanation. Here, we show that higher termites originated 42-54 Ma in Africa and subsequently underwent at least 24 dispersal events between the continents in two main periods. Using phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genomes from 415 species, including all higher termite taxonomic and feeding groups, we inferred 10 dispersal events to South America and Asia 35-23 Ma, coinciding with the sharp decrease in global temperature, sea level, and rainforest cover in the Oligocene. After global temperatures increased, 23-5 Ma, there was only one more dispersal to South America but 11 to Asia and Australia, and one dispersal back to Africa. Most of these dispersal events were transoceanic and might have occurred via floating logs. The spread of higher termites across oceans was helped by the novel ecological opportunities brought about by environmental and ecosystem change, and led termites to become one of the few insect groups with specialized mammal predators. This has parallels with modern invasive species that have been able to thrive in human-impacted ecosystems.},

abstract = {Sequencing microRNA, reduced representation sequencing, Hi-C technology and any method requiring the use of in-house barcodes result in sequencing libraries with low initial sequence diversity. Sequencing such data on the Illumina platform typically produces low quality data due to the limitations of the Illumina cluster calling algorithm. Moreover, even in the case of diverse samples, these limitations are causing substantial inaccuracies in multiplexed sample assignment (sample bleeding). Such inaccuracies are unacceptable in clinical applications, and in some other fields (e.g. detection of rare variants). Here, we discuss how both problems with quality of low-diversity samples and sample bleeding are caused by incorrect detection of clusters on the flowcell during initial sequencing cycles. We propose simple software modifications (Long Template Protocol) that overcome this problem. We present experimental results showing that our Long Template Protocol remarkably increases data quality for low diversity samples, as compared with the standard analysis protocol; it also substantially reduces sample bleeding for all samples. For comprehensiveness, we also discuss and compare experimental results from alternative approaches to sequencing low diversity samples. First, we discuss how the low diversity problem, if caused by barcodes, can be avoided altogether at the barcode design stage. Second and third, we present modified guidelines, which are more stringent than the manufacturer's, for mixing low diversity samples with diverse samples and lowering cluster density, which in our experience consistently produces high quality data from low diversity samples. Fourth and fifth, we present rescue strategies that can be applied when sequencing results in low quality data and when there is no more biological material available. In such cases, we propose that the flowcell be re-hybridized and sequenced again using our Long Template Protocol. Alternatively, we discuss how analysis can be repeated from saved sequencing images using the Long Template Protocol to increase accuracy.},

abstract = {Variation in gene expression leads to phenotypic diversity and plays a central role in caste differentiation of eusocial insect species. In social Hymenoptera, females with the same genetic background can develop into queens or workers, which are characterized by divergent morphologies, behaviours and lifespan. Moreover, many social insects exhibit behaviourally distinct worker castes, such as brood-tenders and foragers. Researchers have just started to explore which genes are differentially expressed to achieve this remarkable phenotypic plasticity. Although the queen is normally the only reproductive individual in the nest, following her removal, young brood-tending workers often develop ovaries and start to reproduce. Here, we make use of this ability in the ant Temnothorax longispinosus and compare gene expression patterns in the queens and three worker castes along a reproductive gradient. We found the largest expression differences between the queen and the worker castes ({\~{}}2500 genes) and the smallest differences between infertile brood-tenders and foragers ({\~{}}300 genes). The expression profile of fertile workers is more worker-like, but to a certain extent intermediate between the queen and the infertile worker castes. In contrast to the queen, a high number of differentially expressed genes in the worker castes are of unknown function, pointing to the derived status of hymenopteran workers within insects.},

abstract = {The evolutionary history of living species is usually inferred through the phylogenetic analysis of molecular and morphological information using various mathematical models. New challenges in phylogenetic analysis are centered mostly on the search for accurate and efficient methods to handle the huge amounts of sequence data generated from newer genome sequencing. The next major challenge is the determination of relationships between the evolution of structural elements and their functional implementation, which is largely ignored in previous analyses. Here, we described the discovery of structural elements in metazoan mitochondrial genomes, termed key K-strings, that can serve as a basis for phylogenetic tree construction. Although comprising only a small fraction (0.73{\%}) of all K-strings, these key K-strings are pivotal to the tree construction because they allow for a significant reduction in the computational time required to construct phylogenetic trees, and more importantly, they make significant improvement to the results of phylogenetic inference. The trees constructed from the key K-strings were consistent overall to our current view of metazoan phylogeny and exhibited a more rational topology than the trees constructed by using other conventional methods. Surprisingly, the key K-strings tended to accumulate in the conserved regions of the original sequences, which were most likely due to strong selection pressure. Furthermore, the special structural features of the key K-strings should have some potential applications in the study of the structures and functions relationship of proteins and in the determination of evolutionary trajectory of species.

As such, they may play important roles in the process of species evolution and their physical existence.

abstract = {Legacy biodiversity data from natural history and survey collections are rapidly becoming available in a common format over the Internet. Over 110 million records are already being served from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). However, our ability to use this information effectively for ecological research, management and conservation lags behind. A solution is a web-based Geographic Information System for enabling visualization and analysis of this rapidly expanding data resource. In this paper we detail a case study system, GBIF Mapping and Analysis Portal Application (MAPA), developed for deployment at distributed database portals. Building such a system requires overcoming a series of technical and research challenges. These challenges include: assuring fast speed of access to the vast amounts of data available through these distributed biodiversity databases; developing open standards based access to suitable environmental data layers for analyzing biodiversity distribution; building suitably flexible and intuitive map interfaces for refining the scope and criteria of an analysis; and building appropriate web-services based analysis tools that are of primary importance to the ecological community and make manifest the value of online biodiversity GBIF data. After discussing how we overcome these challenges, we provide case studies showing two examples of the use of GBIF-MAPA analysis tools. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journalScienceafter the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44{\%} of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26{\%}.

We have found that a single genomic element marked by the protein-encoding gene Gp-9 is responsible for the existence of two distinct forms of social organization in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. This genetic factor influences the reproductive phenotypes and behavioral strategies of queens and determines whether workers tolerate a single fertile queen or multiple queens per colony. Furthermore, this factor affects worker tolerance of queens with alternate genotypes, thus explaining the dramatic differences in Gp-9 allele frequencies observed between the two social forms in the wild. These findings reveal how a single genetic factor can have major effects on complex social behavior and influence the nature of social organization.},

abstract = {Patterns of variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) increasingly are being investigated in threatened or managed species, but not always with clearly defined goals for conservation. In this review I identify uses of mtDNA analysis which fall into two different areas: (i) 'gene conservation' - the identification and management of genetic diversity, and (ii) 'molecular ecology' - the use of mtDNA variation to guide and assist demographic studies of populations. These two classes of application have different conceptual bases, conservation goals and time-frames. Gene conservation makes extensive use of phylogenetic information and is, in general, most relevant to long-term planning. Appropriate uses here include identification of Evolutionarily Significant Units and assessment of conservation priority of taxa or areas from an evolutionary perspective. Less appropriate are inferences about fitness from within-population diversity and about species boundaries. Molecular ecology makes more use of allele frequencies and provides information useful for short-term management of populations. Powerful applications are to identify Management Units and to define and use naturally occurring genetic tags, Estimating demographic parameters, e.g migration rate and population size, from patterns of mtDNA diversity is fraught with difficulty, particularly where populations are fluctuating, and is unlikely to produce quantitative estimates sufficiently accurate to be useful for practical management of contemporary populations. However, through comparative studies, mtDNA analysis can provide qualitative signals of population changes, allowing efficient targeting of resource-intensive ecological studies. Thus, there are some relatively straightforward uses of mtDNA, preferably in conjunction with assays of nuclear variation, that can make a significant contribution to the long-term planning and short-term,execution of species recovery plans.},

abstract = {Unequal usage of synonymous codons in the gene transcript for an amino acid is known as codon usage bias (CUB). It is a unique property of gene as well as genome. Mutation and natural selection are known to be the major factors that influence CUB. Other factors encompass gene expression level, GC content, codon position, recombination rate, RNA stability and gene length. CUB analysis helps in in-depth understanding of the molecular biology, genetics and genome evolution in a species. We used bioinformatic methods to explore the pattern of CUB in MT-ATP6 gene in different classes of platyhelminthes. The analysis is based on genetic code of translational table 14 of National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) where the codon AAA codes for asparagine and TAA for tyrosine amino acid. The synonymous codon usage order (SCUO), an index of CUB, values in different classes namely cestoda, monogenea, rabditophora, trematoda and turbellaria of platyhelminths were found to be 0.43, 0.32, 0.49, 0.40 and 0.36, respectively which suggest that the codon usage bias of ATP6 gene was low (SCUO {\textless} 0.50). Highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) was found between SCUO and various GC contents indicating that GC composition had an influence on CUB. From the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis on codons, we found most of the over-represented codons in all the classes were A/T ending types, which suggested that the preferred codons were influenced by compositional constraints. The PR2 plot revealed asymmetric usage of AT and GC bases among the four fold degenerate codon families with greater usage of G and T over A and C. Highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) was found between overall nucleotide composition and its 3rd codon position suggesting that both natural selection and mutation pressure might have influenced the CUB among different classes. Neutrality analysis revealed that natural selection might play a major role. Mutational responsive index (MRI) and translational selection (P2) values elucidated that selection for translational efficiency moderately affected the codon usage bias in MT-ATP6 gene.},

Here we review perspectives for an integrative taxonomy that directly bear on what species are, how they can be discovered, and how much diversity is on Earth.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that taxonomy needs to be pluralistic to improve species discovery and description, and to develop novel protocols to produce the much-needed inventory of life in a reasonable time. To cope with the large number of candidate species revealed by molecular studies of eukaryotes, we propose a classification scheme for those units that will facilitate the subsequent assembly of data sets for the formal description of new species under the Linnaean system, and will ultimately integrate the activities of taxonomists and molecular biologists.},

The pipeline builds taxon-specific enhanced multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of already annotated sequences and corresponding HMMs using an approximation of the phylogeny. The MSAs are enhanced by fixing unannotated frameshifts, purging of wrong sequences, and removal of non-conserved columns from both ends. A comparison with reference annotations highlights the high quality of the results. The frameshift correction method predicts a large number of frameshifts, many of which are unknown.

abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

We show that the ant-housing Vachellia (Mimosoideae) clade and its ants co-diversified for the past 5 Ma, with some species additionally colonized by younger plant-nesting ant species, someparasitic.Anapparent co-radiation of ants and Tachigali (Caesalpinioideae)was followed bywaves of colonization by the same ant clade, and subsequent occupation by a younger ant group. Wide crown and stem age differences between the ant-housing genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) and its obligate ant inhabitants, and stochastic trait mapping, indicate that its domatium evolved earlier than the ants now occupying it, suggesting previous symbioses that dissolved. Parasitic ant species evolved from generalists, not from mutualists, and are younger than the mutualistic systems they parasitize. Our study illuminates the macroevolutionary assem- bly of ant/plant symbioses, which has been highly dynamic, even in very specialized systems.},

abstract = {The loss of biodiversity is an ongoing problem and it is essential that a framework is established for revealing the status, identifying threats and monitoring future changes of populations. This study focuses on wader populations in the East Asian-Australasian flyway, and aims to develop a three-step framework for monitoring the status of populations. First, population changes of waders are quantified by estimating population indices from nationwide survey data in Japan between 1975 and 2008. Second, species characteristics shared by declining waders are identified using a phylogenetic comparative method. Finally, based on the revealed characteristics of declining species, composite indices are created for monitoring changes in wader communities in the East Asian-Australasian flyway. The estimated population indices revealed that 12 species out of 41, and 16 out of 42 have declined significantly during spring and autumn migration, respectively, in at least one of the past 10, 20 or 30 year-periods. Phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed that both the use of rice fields and dependence on the Yellow Sea negatively affected the population trends of waders. These results are consistent with the hypothesized negative impact of agricultural intensification caused by land consolidation in Japanese rice fields, and habitat loss and/or degradation in the Yellow Sea caused by the rapid growth of populations and economies in China and South Korea. The framework developed in this study can be applied to a wide range of species, and should play an important role in monitoring population trends and identifying threats to those species in future. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It has been used successfully to align the entire human and mouse genomes to each other, and to align numerous smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. A new module permits the alignment of multiple DNA sequence fragments, which has proven valuable in the comparison of incomplete genome sequences. We also describe a method to align more distantly related genomes by detecting protein sequence homology. This extension to MUMmer aligns two genomes after translating the sequence in all six reading frames, extracts all matching protein sequences and then clusters together matches. This method has been applied to both incomplete and complete genome sequences in order to detect regions of conserved synteny, in which multiple proteins from one organism are found in the same order and orientation in another.

This annotation information, which has accumulated over two decades, has been obtained with a diverse set of computational tools and annotation strategies. Despite all efforts of manual curation it is still plagued by misassignments of reading directions, erroneous gene names, and missing as well as false positive annotations in particular for the RNA genes. Taken together, this causes substantial problems for fully automatic pipelines that aim to use these data comprehensively for studies of animal phylogenetics and the molecular evolution of mitogenomes. The MITOS pipeline is designed to compute a consistent de novo annotation of the mitogenomic sequences. We show that the results of MITOS match RefSeq and MitoZoa in terms of annotation coverage and quality. At the same time we avoid biases, inconsistencies of nomenclature, and typos originating from manual curation strategies.

Strumigenys membranifera is one of three Old World dacetine ants, along with Strumigenys rogeri EMERY, 1890 and Strumigenys emmae (EMERY, 1890), with widespread records in both the Old World and the New World. Whereas S. rogeri and S. emmae are almost exclusively tropical, S. membranifera has spread to higher latitudes. Strumigenys membranifera is the only one of the three species with outdoor populations in Europe, e.g., S. membranifera is common in urban parks of southern Spain. In the continental US, S. membranifera has been found in 12 southern states, whereas S. rogeri and S. emmae have outdoor populations only in peninsular Florida. Strumigenys membranifera occurs in a broad range of habitats, including dense forest, cultivated fields, urban lawns, and gardens. Although predators often act as "keystone" species, having a disproportionate impact on the make up of the community, there is no information on what impact S. membranifera may be having on the native fauna in its native or exotic range.},

The enantiomers tested were synthesized from commercially available (S)-2-methylbutan-1-ol or kinetically resolved (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol, prepared using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (PCL). Bioassays conducted in a macadamia orchard on the island of Hawaii demonstrated that W. auropunctata were preferentially attracted to the (S)-enantiomers of both alkyl pyrazines over the racemic mixtures in all experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of differential attraction of ants to the enantiomers of chiral pyrazine pheromones despite many examples of these compounds in the literature.

abstract = {Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been successfully used in phylogenomics for a variety of taxa, but their power in phylogenetic inference has yet to be extensively compared with that of traditional Sanger sequencing data sets. Moreover, UCE data on invertebrates, including insects, are sparse. We compared the phylogenetic informativeness of 959 UCE loci with a multi-locus data set of ten nuclear markers obtained via Sanger sequencing, testing the ability of these two types of data to resolve and date the evolutionary history of the second most species-rich subfamily of ants in the world, the Formicinae. Phylogenetic analyses show that UCEs are superior in resolving ancient and shallow relationships in formicine ants, demonstrated by increased node support and a more resolved phylogeny. Phylogenetic informativeness metrics indicate a twofold improvement relative to the 10-gene data matrix generated from the identical set of taxa. We were able to significantly improve formicine classification based on our comprehensive UCE phylogeny. Our divergence age estimations, using both UCE and Sanger data, indicate that crown-group Formicinae are older (104–117 Ma) than previously suggested. Biogeographic analyses infer that the diversification of the subfamily has occurred on all continents with no particular hub of cladogenesis. We found UCEs to be far superior to the multi-locus data set in estimating formicine relationships. The early history of the clade remains uncertain due to ancient rapid divergence events that are unresolvable even with our genomic-scale data, although this might be largely an effect of several problematic taxa subtended by long branches. Our comparison of divergence ages from both Sanger and UCE data demonstrates the effectiveness of UCEs for dating analyses. This comparative study highlights both the promise and limitations of UCEs for insect phylogenomics, and will prove useful to the growing number of evolutionary biologists considering the transition from Sanger to next-generation sequencing approaches.},

abstract = {Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences from three species of Habronattus jumping spiders (Chelicerata: Arach-nida: Araneae) reveal unusual inferred tRNA secondary structures and gene arrangements, providing new information on tRNA evolution within chelicerate arthropods. Sequences from the protein-coding genes NADH dehy-drogenase subunit 1 (ND1), cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and subunit II (COII) were obtained, along with tRNA Val , tRNA Leu(CUN) , and large-subunit ribosomal RNA (16S) sequences; these revealed several peculiar features. First, inferred secondary structures of tRNA Val and, likely, tRNA Leu(CUN) , lack the TC arm and the variable arm and therefore do not form standard cloverleaf structures. In place of these arms is a 5-6-nt T arm-variable loop (TV) replacement loop such as that originally described from nematode mitochondrial tRNAs. Intraspecific variation occurs in the acceptor stem sequences in both tRNAs. Second, while the proposed secondary structure of the 3 end of 16S is similar to that reported for insects, the sequence at the 5 end is extremely divergent, and the entire gene is truncated about 300 nt with respect to Drosophila yakuba. Third, initiation codons appear to consist of ATY (ATT and ATC) and TTG for ND1 and COII, respectively. Finally, Habronattus shares the same ND1-tRNA Leu(CUN)-16S gene arrangement as insects and crustaceans, thus illustrating variation in a tRNA gene arrangement previously proposed as a character distinguishing chelicerates from insects and crustaceans.},

abstract = {{\{}1.The{\}} two most common approaches for analysing count data are to use a generalised linear model ({\{}GLM{\}}), or transform data and use a linear model ({\{}LM{\}}). The latter has recently been advocated to more reliably maintain control of Type I error rates in tests for no association, while seemingly losing little in power. We make three points on this issue. {\{}2.Point{\}} 1 – Choice of statistical model should primarily be made on the grounds of data properties. Choice of testing procedure should be considered and addressed as a separate issue, after model choice. If models with the appropriate data properties nonetheless have statistical problems such as Type I error control (i.e. Type I error rate greatly exceeds the intended significance level), the best solution is to keep the model but fix the problems. {\{}3.Point{\}} 2 – When a test has problems with Type I error control, it can usually be corrected, but this may require departure from software default approaches. In particular, resampling is a good solution for small samples that can be easy to implement. {\{}4.Point{\}} 3 – Tests based on models that better fit the data (e.g. a negative binomial for over-dispersed count data) tend to have better power properties and in some instances have considerably higher power. {\{}5.We{\}} illustrate these issues for a 2 X 2 experiment with a count response. This seemingly simple problem becomes hard when the experimental design is unbalanced, and software default procedures using {\{}LMs{\}} or {\{}GLMs{\}} can have difficulties, although in both cases the issues can be fixed. {\{}6.We{\}} conclude that, when {\{}GLMs{\}} are thought to fit count data well, and when any necessary steps are taken to correct Type I error rates, they should be used rather than {\{}LMs{\}}. Nonetheless, standard {\{}LM{\}} tests are often robust and can have good Type I error control, so there is an argument for their use for counts when diagnostics are difficult and statistical models are complex, although at some risk of loss of power and interpretability.

abstract = {The serial endosymbiosis theory is a favored model for explaining the origin of mitochondria, a defining event in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. As usually described, this theory posits that mitochondria are the direct descendants of a bacterial endosymbiont that became established at an early stage in a nucleus-containing (but amitochondriate) host cell. Gene sequence data strongly support a monophyletic origin of the mitochondrion from a eubacterial ancestor shared with a subgroup of the alpha-Proteobacteria. However, recent studies of unicellular eukaryotes (protists), some of them little known, have provided insights that challenge the traditional serial endosymbiosis-based view of how the eukaryotic cell and its mitochondrion came to be. These data indicate that the mitochondrion arose in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this organelle originated at essentially the same time as the nuclear component of the eukaryotic cell rather than in a separate, subsequent event.},

In her article, not only did Margulis champion an endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and plastids from bacterial ancestors, but she also posited that the eukaryotic flagellum (undulipodium in her usage) and mitotic apparatus originated from an endosymbiotic, spirochete-like organism. In essence, she presented a comprehensive symbiotic view of eukaryotic cell evolution (eukaryogenesis). Not all of the ideas in her article have been accepted, for want of compelling evidence, but her vigorous promotion of the role of symbiosis in cell evolution unquestionably had a major influence on how subsequent investigators have viewed the origin and evolution of mitochondria and plastids and the eukaryotic cell per se.},

abstract = {The complete mitochondrial genome and a set of polymorphic microsatellite markers were identified by 454 pyrosequencing (1/16th of a plate) for the New Caledonian rainforest spider-ant Leptomyrmex pallens. De novo genome assembly recovered the entire mitochondrial genome with mean coverage of 8.9-fold (range 1-27). The mitogenome consists of 15,591 base pairs including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal subunit genes, 22 transfer RNAs, and a non-coding AT-rich region. The genome arrangement is typical of insect taxa and very similar to the only other published ant mitogenome from the Solenopsis genus, with the main differences consisting of translocations and inversions of tRNAs. A total of 13 polymorphic loci were also characterized using 41 individuals from a single population in the Aoupini{\'{e}} region, corresponding to workers from 21 nests and 16 foraging workers. We observed moderate genetic variation across most loci (mean number of alleles per locus = 4.50; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.53) with evidence of only two loci deviating significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to null alleles. Marker independence was confirmed with tests for linkage disequilibrium. Most loci cross amplified for three additional Leptomyrmex species. The annotation of the mitogenome and characterization of microsatellite markers will provide useful tools for assessing the colony structure, population genetic patterns, and dispersal strategy of L. pallens in the context of rainforest fragmentation in New Caledonia. Furthermore, this paper confirms a recent line of evidence that comprehensive mitochondrial data can be obtained relatively easily from small next-generation sequencing analyses. Greater synthesis of next-generation sequencing data will play a significant role in expanding the taxonomic representation of mitochondrial genome sequences.},

abstract = {In the annual cycle of migratory birds, temporal and energetic constraints can lead to carry-over effects, in which performance in one life history stage affects later stages. Bar-tailed godwits Limosa lapponica baueri, which achieve remarkably high pre-migratory fuel loads, undertake the longest non-stop migratory flights yet recorded, and breed during brief high-latitude summers, may be particularly vulnerable to persistent effects of disruptions to their rigidly-timed annual routines. Using three years of non-breeding data in New Zealand, we asked how arrival timing after a non-stop flight from Alaska ({\textgreater}11 000 km) affected an individual godwit's performance in subsequent flight feather moult, contour feather moults, and migratory departure. Late arrival led to later wing moult, but godwits partially compensated for delayed moult initiation by increasing moult rate and decreasing the total duration of moult. Delays in arrival and wing moult up to 3437 d had no apparent effect on an individual's migratory departure or extent of breeding plumage at departure, both of which were extraordinarily consistent between years. Thus, errors in timing early in the non-breeding season were essentially corrected in New Zealand prior to spring migration. Variation in migration timing also had no apparent effect on an individual's likelihood of returning the following season. The bar-tailed godwits rigid maintenance of plumage and spring migration schedules, coupled with high annual survival, imply a surprising degree of flexibility to address unforeseen circumstances in the annual cycle.},

Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade.

abstract = {Animal mitochondrial DNA is a small, extrachromosomal genome, typically approximately 16 kb in size. With few exceptions, all animal mitochondrial genomes contain the same 37 genes: two for rRNAs, 13 for proteins and 22 for tRNAs. The products of these genes, along with RNAs and proteins imported from the cytoplasm, endow mitochondria with their own systems for DNA replication, transcription, mRNA processing and translation of proteins. The study of these genomes as they function in mitochondrial systems-'mitochondrial genomics'-serves as a model for genome evolution. Furthermore, the comparison of animal mitochondrial gene arrangements has become a very powerful means for inferring ancient evolutionary relationships, since rearrangements appear to be unique, generally rare events that are unlikely to arise independently in separate evolutionary lineages. Complete mitochondrial gene arrangements have been published for 58 chordate species and 29 non-chordate species, and partial arrangements for hundreds of other taxa. This review compares and summarizes these gene arrangements and points out some of the questions that may be addressed by comparing mitochondrial systems.},

In the US, G. hartmani populations are known only from Texas and Louisiana, yet there is much apparently suitable habitat along the Gulf coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. Given the remarkable scarcity of G. hartmani records throughout its known range, it remains possible that G. hartmani populations occur all along the Gulf coast of the US, but have been overlooked.},

The genome arrangement is typical of insect taxa and very similar to the only other published ant mitogenome from the Solenopsis genus, with the main differences consisting of translocations and inversions of tRNAs. A total of 13 polymorphic loci were also characterized using 41 indi-viduals from a single population in the Aoupini{\'{e}} region, corresponding to workers from 21 nests and 16 foraging workers. We observed moderate genetic variation across most loci (mean number of alleles per locus = 4.50; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.53) with evidence of only two loci deviating significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium due to null alleles. Marker independence was confirmed with tests for linkage disequilibrium. Most loci cross amplified for three additional Leptomyrmex species. The annotation of the mitogenome and characterization of microsatellite markers will provide useful tools for assessing the colony structure, population genetic patterns, and dispersal strategy of L. pallens in the context of rain-forest fragmentation in New Caledonia. Furthermore, this paper confirms a recent line of evidence that comprehen-sive mitochondrial data can be obtained relatively easily from small next-generation sequencing analyses. Greater synthesis of next-generation sequencing data will play a significant role in expanding the taxonomic representation of mitochondrial genome sequences.},

To document the worldwide spread of T. caldarium, we compiled {\textgreater} 300 published and unpublished specimen site records. In addition, in order to assess their species boundaries, we examined the type specimens of T. caldarium and T. simillimum. We documented Tetramorium caldarium records from 67 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major Caribbean islands, and US states), including several for which there are no previously published records: Austral Islands, Australia, Benin, Cameroon, Cayman Islands, Congo (Republic), Cura{\c{c}}ao, Dubai, El Salvador, Gabon, Guadeloupe, Indonesia, Jamaica, Martinique, Namibia, Panama, Scotland, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. Tetramorium caldarium is truly cosmopolitan, with records spread across seven of the world's eight bioregions (all except the Antarctic, which has no ants). Tetramorium caldarium records are particularly common on Atlantic islands and from greenhouses and heated buildings in temperate Europe.},

abstract = {Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the great success stories in the history of life on Earth. From their first appearance in the Early Cretaceous, ants have come to occupy keystone positions in virtually all major terrestrial habitats, and they are absent only from Antarctica and a few inhospitable or remote islands. Despite the interest ants have long generated, our understanding of their taxonomy, diversity, evolution and ecology is far from complete. It is estimated that only half of the world's ant species - currently numbering about 12,200 - have been described. AntWeb's [www.antweb.org] mission is to develop tools to accelerate the discovery and documentation of ant diversity, and ensure ant information is widely accessible across a broad community. As such, AntWeb is the world's largest online database of images, specimen records, and natural history information on ants. A standardized digitizing protocol has been set up for extant species, which optimizes the image acquisition of each specimen in dorsal, profile, and head views, as well as the wings and male genitalia when applicable. As of July 2012, AntWeb has approximately 84000 high quality images of 20000 specimens representing over 9010 extant species. But the picture would be incomplete without the fossils. Recently the world catalogue of the fossil ants was added, which comprises 661 valid extinct species each represented by a single or few specimens disseminated in various fossil collections throughout the world. Besides the difficulty to access some of them, the main limitation to digitizing fossil ants is their mode of preservation. From spectacularly preserved specimens entombed within amber and showing the finest details of cuticular sculpturing, to the often shadowy outlines hinting at a structure that seems just out of view provided by an imprint, fossil ants often cannot be imaged following all the standards of extant specimens, and instead require specific methods for high quality image acquisition.},

abstract = {Molecular tools are a standard part of many conservation studies and can be informative at many different levels of analysis, although there are inherent limitations and strengths of different genes or parts of genes to inform specific questions. Animal DNA barcodes, 600- to 800-base-pair segments of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I, have been proposed as a means to quantify global biodiversity. Although mitochondrial (mt) DNA has a long history of use at the species level, recent analyses suggest that the use of a single gene, particularly mitochondrial, is unlikely to yield data that are balanced, universally acceptable, or sufficient in taxonomic scope to recognize many species lineages. Mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have different patterns of evolution and modes of inheritance, which can result in very different assessments of biodiversity. The ramifications of choosing a particular definition of species (species concept) need to be carefully considered because current efforts have designated DNA barcodes as the universal species concept without demonstrating its superiority over preexisting concepts. The results of such a barcoding paradigm may include a failure to recognize significant portions of biodiversity or nuclear/mitochondrial mixed lineages and could spuriously focus conservation resources on populations with relatively minor mtDNA divergence. DNA barcodes are most likely to provide potentially useful information for groups that are already well studied, and such taxa do not constitute the majority of biodiversity or those in most need of research attention. DNA barcode-length sequences are an important source of data but, when used alone or out of context, may offer only a fraction of the information needed to characterize species while taking resources from broader studies that could produce information essential to robust and informed conservation decisions.},

abstract = {Because of their crucial role in ecotoxicological risk assessment, amphipods (Crustacea) are commonly employed as model species in a wide range of studies. However, despite their ecological importance, their genome has not yet been completely annotated and molecular mechanisms underlying key pathways, such as the serotonin pathway, in development of ecotoxicological biomarkers of exposure to neuroactive pharmaceuticals are still poorly understood. Furthermore, genetic similarities and discrepancies with other model arthropods (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster) have not been completely clarified. In this report, we present a new transcriptome assembly of Gammarus fossarum, an important amphipod species, widespread in Central Europe. RNA-Seq with Illumina HiSeq technology was used to analyse samples extracted from total internal tissues. We used the Trinity and Trinotate software suites for transcriptome assembly and annotation, respectively. The quality of this assembly and the affiliated targeted homology searches greatly enrich the molecular knowledge on this species. Because of the lack of publicly available molecular information on the serotonin pathway, we also highlighted sequence homologies and divergences of the genes encoding the serotonin pathway components of the well-annotated arthropod D. melanogaster, and Crustacea with the corresponding genes of our assembly. An inferior number of hits was found when running a BLAST analysis of both D. melanogaster and Crustacea mRNA sequences encoding serotonin receptors available in GenBank against the total assembly, compared to other serotonin pathway components. A lack of information on important components for serotonin biosynthesis and vesicle endocytosis (i.e., tryptophan hydroxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter) in Crustacea was also brought to light. Our results will provide an extensive transcriptional resource for this important species in ecotoxicological risk assessment and highlight the need for a more detailed categorization of neuronal pathways components in invertebrates.},

abstract = {Squamate reptiles number approximately 8000 living species and are a major component of the world's terrestrial vertebrate diversity. However, the established relationships of the higher-level groups have been questioned in recent molecular analyses. Here we expand the molecular data to include DNA sequences, totaling 6192 base pairs (bp), from nine nuclear protein-coding genes (C-mos, RAG1, RAG2, R35, HOXA13, JUN, $\alpha$-enolase, amelogenin and MAFB) for 19 taxa representing all major lineages. Our phylogenetic analyses yield a largely resolved phylogeny that challenges previous morphological analyses and requires a new classification. The limbless dibamids are the most basal squamates. Of the remaining taxa (Bifurcata), the gekkonids form a basal lineage. The Unidentata, squamates that are neither dibamids nor gekkonids, are divided into the Scinciformata (scincids, xantusiids, and cordylids) and the Episquamata (remaining taxa). Episquamata includes Laterata (Teiformata, Lacertiformata, and Amphisbaenia, with the latter two joined in Lacertibaenia) and Toxicofera (iguanians, anguimorphs and snakes). Our results reject several previous hypotheses that identified either the varanids, or a burrowing lineage such as amphisbaenians or dibamids, as the closest relative of snakes. Our study also rejects the monophyly of both Scleroglossa and Autarchoglossa, because Iguania, a species-rich lineage (ca. 1440 sp.), is in a highly nested position rather than being basal among Squamata. Thus iguanians should not be viewed as representing a primitive state of squamate evolution but rather a specialized and successful clade combining lingual prehension, dependence on visual cues, and ambush foraging mode, and which feeds mainly on prey avoided by other squamates. Molecular time estimates show that the Triassic and Jurassic (from 250 to 150 Myr) were important times for squamate evolution and diversification.},

Several explanations for the disparity of biological diversity in the tropics compared to temperate regions have been proposed including that the tropics may act as a "museum" where older lineages persist through evolutionary time or as a "cradle" where new species continue to be generated. We infer the molecular phylogenetic relationships of 295 ant specimens including members of all 21 extant subfamilies to explore the evolutionary diversification and biogeography of the ants. By constraining the topology and age of the root node while using 45 fossils as minimum constraints, we converge on an age of 139-158 Mya for the modern ants. Further diversification analyses identified 10 periods with a significant change in the tempo of diversification of the ants, although these shifts did not appear to correspond to ancestral biogeographic range shifts. Likelihood-based historical biogeographic reconstructions suggest that the Neotropics were important in early ant diversification (e.g., Cretaceous). This finding coupled with the extremely high-current species diversity suggests that the Neotropics have acted as both a museum and cradle for ant diversity.},

abstract = {This study investigates the evolutionary history of a hyperdiverse clade, the ant subfamily Myrmicinae (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), based on analyses of a data matrix comprising 251 species and 11 nuclear gene fragments. Under both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of inference, we recover a robust phylogeny that reveals six major clades of Myrmicinae, here treated as newly defined tribes and occurring as a pectinate series: Myrmicini, Pogonomyrmecini trib.n., Stenammini, Solenopsidini, Attini and Crematogastrini. Because we condense the former 25 myrmicine tribes into a new six-tribe scheme, membership in some tribes is now notably different, especially regarding Attini. We demonstrate that the monotypic genus Ankylomyrma is neither in the Myrmicinae nor even a member of the more inclusive formicoid clade—rather it is a poneroid ant, sister to the genus Tatuidris (Agroecomyrmecinae). Several species-rich myrmicine genera are shown to be nonmonophyletic, including Pogonomyrmex, Aphaenogaster, Messor, Monomorium, Pheidole, Temnothorax and Tetramorium. We propose a number of generic synonymies to partially alleviate these problems (senior synonym listed first): Pheidole = Anisopheidole syn.n. = Machomyrma syn.n.; Temnothorax = Chalepoxenus syn.n. = Myrmoxenus syn.n. = Protomognathus syn.n.; Tetramorium = Rhoptromyrmex syn.n. = Anergates syn.n. = Teleutomyrmex syn.n. The genus Veromessor stat.r. is resurrected for the New World species previously placed in Messor; Syllophopsis stat.r. is resurrected from synonymy under Monomorium to contain the species in the hildebrandti group; Trichomyrmex stat.r. is resurrected from synonymy under Monomorium to contain the species in the scabriceps- and destructor-groups; and the monotypic genus Epelysidris stat.r. is reinstated for Monomorium brocha. Bayesian divergence dating indicates that the crown group Myrmicinae originated about 98.6 Ma (95{\%} highest probability density 87.9–109.6 Ma) but the six major clades are considerably younger, with age estimates ranging from 52.3 to 71.1 Ma. Although these and other suprageneric taxa arose mostly in the middle Eocene or earlier, a number of prominent, species-rich genera, such as Pheidole, Cephalotes, Strumigenys, Crematogaster and Tetramorium, have estimated crown group origins in the late Eocene or Oligocene. Most myrmicine species diversity resides in the two sister clades, Attini and Crematogastrini, which are estimated to have originated and diversified extensively in the Neotropics and Paleotropics, respectively. The newly circumscribed Myrmicini is Holarctic in distribution, and ancestral range estimation suggests a Nearctic origin. The Pogonomyrmecini and Solenopsidini are reconstructed as being Neotropical in origin, but they have subsequently colonized the Nearctic region (Pogonomyrmecini) and many parts of the Old World as well as the Nearctic region (Solenopsidini), respectively. The Stenammini have flourished primarily in the northern hemisphere, and are most likely of Nearctic origin, but selected lineages have dispersed to the northern Neotropics and the Paleotropics. Thus the evolutionary history of the Myrmicinae has played out on a global stage over the last 100 Ma, with no single region being the principal generator of species diversity.

I documented the earliest known P. sennaarensis records for 40 countries, including several for which I found no previously published records: Bahrain, Chad, India, Liberia, Mozambique, {\&} Zambia. In 1925, when most of the world's ant fauna was still poorly documented, P. sennaarensis had already been collected from widely scattered locales in 26 countries across tropical Africa {\&} Arabia. In addition, there is a single isolated 1896 record of P. sennaarensis from an apparently temporary population in tropical India. All P. sennaarensis records from subtropical sites north of 23.4-degrees-N (in Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, {\&} Saudi Arabia) are from after 1950, except one record from just outside the tropics (Muscat, Oman; 23.6-degrees-N). It is possible that P. sennaarensis populations have lived in these subtropical areas for a long time, but are only now being reported, perhaps due to a recent population increase of this species. In fact, although the earliest specimen record from Iran dates to 2001, older residents of SE Iran remember the sting of P. sennaarensis from their childhood. Still, it is possible that P. sennaarensis has really expanded its geographic range northeastward into new regions during the past few decades.]},

abstract = {The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, has been increasing in importance as an exotic pest. Here we review published and unpub-lished information on its distribution, ecology, impact, and control. Wasmannia auropunctata occurs throughout most of the warmer parts of the New World, from subtropical Argentina to subtropical Mexico and through much of the Caribbean, though it is not clear whether this species in native to this entire region. During the past century, exotic populations of W. auropunctata have become established in numerous other places, including the Galapagos Islands, West Africa (Gabon, Cameroon, and possibly the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo), Melanesia (New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and possibly Tuvalu), Polynesia (Wallis and Futuna and Hawaii), the mainland US (Florida and possibly California), and on subtropical Atlantic islands (the Bahamas and Bermuda). The latitudi-nal range of known outdoors populations of W. auropunctata is from 32{\textordmasculine}40'S in Argentina to 32{\textordmasculine}20'N in Bermuda. Wasmannia auropunctata is also a greenhouse pest in more temperate regions, such as England and Canada. In many areas, W. auropunctata can be a significant agricultural pest, not only stinging agricultural workers, but also enhancing populations of Homoptera. Homoptera cause damage both through sapping plants of nutrients and by increasing the occurrence of diseases, including viral and fungal infections. In addition, W. auropunctata has negative impacts on many animals, both inverte-brates and vertebrates, though most reports on such impact have been anecdotal. The impacts of W. auropunctata populations seem to be most severe on tropical islands where it is not native, such as the Galapagos, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. Reports of widespread blindness in both domestic and native mammals caused by W. auropunctata stings deserve serious attention. Chemical control of W. auropunctata may be possible for small exotic populations spread over a few dozen hectares or less. For large exotic infestations, the only hope for long-term control appears to be classical biocontrol.},

In a few cases incidental transmission of paternal mtDNA was observed and estimated to account for only 10(-4)-10(-3) of an individual's mtDNA content. In contrast, biparental inheritance is common in mussels of the genus Mytilus. Here we present direct evidence that sex and mtDNA inheritance are coupled in Mytilus. Females inherit mtDNA only from their mother, but they transmit it to both daughters and sons. Males inherit mtDNA from both parents, but they transmit to sons only the mtDNA they inherited from their father. In pair matings, this mtDNA inheritance pattern is associated with a strong sex-ratio bias. These findings establish a newly discovered type of cytoplasmic DNA transmission. We also present evidence that the phenomenon breaks down in interspecific hybrids.},

abstract = {The stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse lineage of hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described species and a diversity of life history traits, including ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation, pollen feeding (bees [Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid wasps, ants, and some bees) [1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4–11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5–7]. We used ultraconserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from {\textgreater}800 UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference.},

abstract = {We investigated phylogenetic relationships among the ‘primitive' Australian ant genera Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia (stat. rev.) and the Baltic amber fossil genus Prionomyrmex, using a combination of morphological and molecular data. Outgroups for the analysis included representatives from a variety of potential sister-groups, including five extant subfamilies of ants and one extinct group (Sphecomyrminae). Parsimony analysis of the morphological data provides strong support ({\~{}}95{\%} bootstrap proportions) for the monophyly of (1) genus Myrmecia, (2) genus Prionomyrmex, and (3) a clade containing those two genera plus Nothomyrmecia. A group comprising Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex is also upheld (85{\%} bootstrap support). Molecular sequence data ({\~{}}2200 base pairs from the 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes) corroborate these findings for extant taxa, with Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia appearing as sister-groups with {\~{}}100{\%} bootstrap support under parsimony, neighbour-joining and maximum-likelihood analyses. Neither the molecular nor the morphological data set allows us to identify unambiguously the sister-group of (Myrmecia + (Nothomyrmecia + Prionomyrmex)). Rather, Myrmecia and relatives are part of an unresolved polytomy that encompasses most of the ant subfamilies. Taken as a whole, our results support the contention that many of the major lineages of ants – including a clade that later came to contain Myrmecia, Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex – arose at around the same time during a bout of diversification in the middle or late Cretaceous. On the basis of Bayesian dating analysis, the estimated age of the most recent common ancestor of Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia is 74 million years (95{\%} confidence limits, 53–101 million years), a result consistent with the origin of the myrmeciine stem lineage in the Cretaceous. The ant subfamily Myrmeciinae is redefined to contain two tribes, Myrmeciini (genus Myrmecia) and Prionomyrmecini (Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex). Phylogenetic analysis of the enigmatic Argentine fossils Ameghinoia and Polanskiella demonstrates that they are also members of the Myrmeciinae, probably more closely related to Prionomyrmecini than to Myrmeciini. Thus, the myrmeciine ants appear to be a formerly widespread group that retained many ancestral formicid characteristics and that became extinct everywhere except in the Australian region.},

abstract = {The complete mitochondrial genome and a set of polymorphic microsatellite markers were identified by 454 pyrosequencing (1/16th of a plate) for the New Caledonian rainforest spider-ant Leptomyrmex pallens. De novo genome assembly recovered the entire mitochondrial genome with mean coverage of 8.9-fold (range 1-27). The mitogenome consists of 15,591 base pairs including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal subunit genes, 22 transfer RNAs, and a non-coding AT-rich region. The genome arrangement is typical of insect taxa and very similar to the only other published ant mitogenome from the Solenopsis genus, with the main differences consisting of translocations and inversions of tRNAs. A total of 13 polymorphic loci were also characterized using 41 individuals from a single population in the Aoupini{\'{e}} region, corresponding to workers from 21 nests and 16 foraging workers. We observed moderate genetic variation across most loci (mean number of alleles per locus = 4.50; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.53) with evidence of only two loci deviating significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to null alleles. Marker independence was confirmed with tests for linkage disequilibrium. Most loci cross amplified for three additional Leptomyrmex species. The annotation of the mitogenome and characterization of microsatellite markers will provide useful tools for assessing the colony structure, population genetic patterns, and dispersal strategy of L. pallens in the context of rainforest fragmentation in New Caledonia. Furthermore, this paper confirms a recent line of evidence that comprehensive mitochondrial data can be obtained relatively easily from small next-generation sequencing analyses. Greater synthesis of next-generation sequencing data will play a significant role in expanding the taxonomic representation of mitochondrial genome sequences.},

Many software packages have been developed for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treatment groups based on RNA-Seq data. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to approach an optimal study design and choice of suitable software for the analysis. In this comparative study we evaluate the performance of three of the most frequently used software tools: Cufflinks-Cuffdiff2, DESeq and edgeR. A number of important parameters of RNA-Seq technology were taken into consideration, including the number of replicates, sequencing depth, and balanced vs. unbalanced sequencing depth within and between groups. We benchmarked results relative to sets of DEGs identified through either quantitative RT-PCR or microarray. We observed that edgeR performs slightly better than DESeq and Cuffdiff2 in terms of the ability to uncover true positives. Overall, DESeq or taking the intersection of DEGs from two or more tools is recommended if the number of false positives is a major concern in the study. In other circumstances, edgeR is slightly preferable for differential expression analysis at the expense of potentially introducing more false positives.},

abstract = {{\{}1.The{\}} two most common approaches for analysing count data are to use a generalised linear model ({\{}GLM{\}}), or transform data and use a linear model ({\{}LM{\}}). The latter has recently been advocated to more reliably maintain control of Type I error rates in tests for no association, while seemingly losing little in power. We make three points on this issue. {\{}2.Point{\}} 1 – Choice of statistical model should primarily be made on the grounds of data properties. Choice of testing procedure should be considered and addressed as a separate issue, after model choice. If models with the appropriate data properties nonetheless have statistical problems such as Type I error control (i.e. Type I error rate greatly exceeds the intended significance level), the best solution is to keep the model but fix the problems. {\{}3.Point{\}} 2 – When a test has problems with Type I error control, it can usually be corrected, but this may require departure from software default approaches. In particular, resampling is a good solution for small samples that can be easy to implement. {\{}4.Point{\}} 3 – Tests based on models that better fit the data (e.g. a negative binomial for over-dispersed count data) tend to have better power properties and in some instances have considerably higher power. {\{}5.We{\}} illustrate these issues for a 2 X 2 experiment with a count response. This seemingly simple problem becomes hard when the experimental design is unbalanced, and software default procedures using {\{}LMs{\}} or {\{}GLMs{\}} can have difficulties, although in both cases the issues can be fixed. {\{}6.We{\}} conclude that, when {\{}GLMs{\}} are thought to fit count data well, and when any necessary steps are taken to correct Type I error rates, they should be used rather than {\{}LMs{\}}. Nonetheless, standard {\{}LM{\}} tests are often robust and can have good Type I error control, so there is an argument for their use for counts when diagnostics are difficult and statistical models are complex, although at some risk of loss of power and interpretability.

A new module permits the alignment of multiple DNA sequence fragments, which has proven valuable in the comparison of incomplete genome sequences. We also describe a method to align more distantly related genomes by detecting protein sequence homology. This extension to MUMmer aligns two genomes after translating the sequence in all six reading frames, extracts all matching protein sequences and then clusters together matches. This method has been applied to both incomplete and complete genome sequences in order to detect regions of conserved synteny, in which multiple proteins from one organism are found in the same order and orientation in another.

abstract = {The Yangtze River Basin in China is one of the global hotspots of freshwater mussel (order Unionida) diversity with 68 nominal species. Few studies have tested the validity of these nominal species. Some taxa from the Yangtze unionid fauna have not been adequately examined using molecular data and well-positioned phylogenetically with respect to the global Unionida. We evaluated species boundaries of Chinese freshwater mussels, and disentangled their phylogenetic relationships within the context of the global freshwater mussels based on the multi-locus data and complete mitochondrial genomes. Moreover, we produced the time-calibrated phylogeny of Unionida and explored patterns of diversification. COI barcode data suggested the existence of 41 phylogenetic distinct species from our sampled 40 nominal taxa inhabiting the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses on three loci (COI, 16S, and 28S) and complete mitochondrial genomes showed that the subfamily Unioninae sensu stricto was paraphyletic, and the subfamily Anodontinae should be subsumed under Unioninae. In addition, we described two new tribes (Aculamprotulini tribe nov. and Lepidodesmini tribe nov.) in the subfamily Unioninae and one new genus (Parvasolenaia gen. nov.) in the subfamily Gonideinae. Molecular dating analysis suggested freshwater mussels diversified at 346.1 Mya (HPD = 286.6–409.9). The global diversification rate for Unionida was estimated to be 0.025 species/Myr. Our study found only a single well-supported rate shift in Unionida diversification, occurring at the base of the subfamily Ambleminae. The evolution of active host-attraction may have triggered the burst of speciation in Ambleminae, and the environment and geography of the Mississippi River Basin likely sustained this radiation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The lack of effective biodiversity baselines is a major impairment to implement conservation plans. Hence, constructing and updating species lists provides vital information about species distribution records. The Sustainable Amazon Network (in Portuguese Rede Amaz{\^{o}}nia Sustent{\'{a}}vel; RAS) is an interdisciplinary research initiative that aims to evaluate land-cover changes effects in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Within the scope of this project, we sampled ants and orchid bees and herein present a list of species collected in Paragominas, PA, Brazil; the most complete lists of species published to date of these groups for the eastern Amazon. We sampled these insects across several land-cover types, from undisturbed primary forest, through varyingly disturbed primary and secondary forests to production areas (silviculture, pastures and arable fields). In total we recorded 285 species of ants and 36 species of orchid bees. Species richness was higher in primary forests for both groups, followed by production areas. Orchid bees reached their highest richness in secondary forests. For orchid bees, production areas were dominated by a few hyper-dominant species, such as Eulaema nigrita. We acknowledge that the use of different sampling methods would collect additional species, and we recommend this for future assessments if the aim is to make a complete inventory. We expect this study can be used as a baseline for understanding the effectiveness of ongoing changes in forest conservation and land management practices. Finally, this list is of suitable importance in determining conservation status for several taxa described here.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They are eusocial insects that exhibit social organization, foraging, fungus-cultivation, hygiene and a complex nest structure, which render their management notoriously difficult. A lack of economic thresholds and sampling plans focused on the main pest species preclude the management of leaf-cutting ants; such management would facilitate their control and lessen insecticide overuse, particularly the use of insecticidal baits. Recent restrictions on the use of synthetic compounds for such purposes impose additional challenges for the management of leaf-cutting ants. Considerable effort has been exerted regarding these challenges, which are addressed herein, but which also remain challenges that are yet to be conquered.},

To begin to reconcile these perspectives, we studied how the evolutionary conservation of genes associated with social behavior depends on regulatory context, and whether genes associated with social behavior exist in distinct regulatory and evolutionary contexts. We identified modules of co-expressed genes associated with age-based division of labor between nurses and foragers in the ant Monomorium pharaonis, and we studied the relationship between molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression. Highly connected and expressed genes were more evolutionarily conserved, as expected. However, compared to the rest of the genome, forager-upregulated genes were much more highly connected and conserved, while nurse-upregulated genes were less connected and more evolutionarily labile. Our results indicate that the genetic architecture of social behavior includes both highly connected and conserved components as well as loosely connected and evolutionarily labile components.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Army ants are dominant invertebrate predators in tropical and subtropical terrestrial ecosystems. Their close relatives within the dorylomorph group of ants are also highly specialized predators, although much less is known about their biology. We analyzed molecular data generated from 11 nuclear genes to infer a phylogeny for the major dorylomorph lineages, and incorporated fossil evidence to infer divergence times under a relaxed molecular clock.RESULTS:Because our results indicate that one subfamily and several genera of dorylomorphs are non-monophyletic, we propose to subsume the six previous dorylomorph subfamilies into a single subfamily, Dorylinae. We find the monophyly of Dorylinae to be strongly supported and estimate the crown age of the group at 87 (74-101) million years. Our phylogenetic analyses provide only weak support for army ant monophyly and also call into question a previous hypothesis that army ants underwent a fundamental split into New World and Old World lineages. Outside the army ants, our phylogeny reveals for the first time many old, distinct lineages in the Dorylinae. The genus Cerapachys is shown to be non-monophyletic and comprised of multiple lineages scattered across the Dorylinae tree. We recover, with strong support, novel relationships among these Cerapachys-like clades and other doryline genera, but divergences in the deepest parts of the tree are not well resolved. We find the genus Sphinctomyrmex, characterized by distinctive abdominal constrictions, to consist of two separate lineages with convergent morphologies, one inhabiting the Old World and the other the New World tropics.CONCLUSIONS:While we obtain good resolution in many parts of the Dorylinae phylogeny, relationships deep in the tree remain unresolved, with major lineages joining each other in various ways depending upon the analytical method employed, but always with short internodes. This may be indicative of rapid radiation in the early history of the Dorylinae, but additional molecular data and more complete species sampling are needed for confirmation. Our phylogeny now provides a basic framework for comparative biological analyses, but much additional study on the behavior and morphology of doryline species is needed, especially investigations directed at the non-army ant taxa.},

abstract = {The social complexity that characterizes the eusocial insects strongly affects all aspects of social insect life, including the molecular and evolutionary genetic basis of social insect traits. Quantitative genetic theory and empirical approaches have been developed over the past 60 years specifically to study the genetic implications of social interactions. Surprisingly, given the obvious biological importance of social interactions in social insects, this research tradition has been and continues to be widely overlooked throughout the social insect literature, including in recent sociogenomic studies focused on understanding the molecular underpinnings of social life. Instead, the overwhelming majority of social insect genetic research has relied on conventional genetic approaches developed for solitary organisms focused on the one-to-one association of an individual's genes to its own traits. I survey social insect studies that conclusively demonstrate the importance of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which arise from social interactions, for social insect trait expression and evolution. I explain why these genetically based social effects are expected to be ubiquitous in social insects and I explain the relevance of the IGE framework, originally developed within quantitative genetics, for molecular genetic studies of social insect traits such as behaviour and caste. I discuss the problems of ignoring IGEs and relying solely on conventional direct genetic effect approaches. Finally, I discuss the strong potential of using the IGE approach and other more systems-level-focused approaches to complement conventional reductionist approaches in elucidating the genetic basis of social insect trait expression and evolution.},

Affected individuals demonstrate an abnormal posture and varying degrees of ataxia. The homeobox (HOX) gene cluster is involved in the development of both the axial and appendicular skeleton. Hoxd3-null mice demonstrate a strikingly similar phenotype to Arabian foals with OAAM. Whole-genome sequencing was performed in an OAAM-affected horse (OAAM1) and seven unaffected Arabian horses. Visual inspection of the raw reads within the region of HOXD3 identified a 2.7-kb deletion located 4.4 kb downstream of the end of HOXD4 and 8.2 kb upstream of the start of HOXD3. A genotyping assay revealed that both parents of OAAM1 were heterozygous for the deletion. Additional genotyping identified two of 162 heterozygote Arabians, and the deletion was not present in 371 horses of other breeds. Comparative genomics studies have revealed that this region is highly conserved across species and that the entire genomic region between Hoxd4 and Hoxd3 is transcribed in mice. Two additional Arabian foals diagnosed with OAAM (OAAM 2 and 3) were genotyped and did not have the 2.7-kb deletion. Closer examination of the phenotype in these cases revealed notable variation. OAAM3 also had facial malformations and a patent ductus arteriosus, and the actual malformation at the craniocervical junction differed. Genetic heterogeneity may exist across the HOXD locus in Arabian foals with OAAM.},

There are however a lot of global health challenges with diseases such as cancer, degenerative diseases, HIV/AIDS and diabetes, of which modern medicine is struggling to provide cures. Many times the isolation of {\&}ldquo;active compound{\&}rdquo; has made the compound ineffective. Drug discovery is a multidimensional problem requiring several parameters of both natural and synthetic compounds such as safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy to be evaluated during drug candidate selection. The advent of latest technologies that enhance drug design hypotheses such as Artificial Intelligence, the use of {\&}lsquo;organ-on chip{\&}rsquo; and microfluidics technologies, means that automation has become part of drug discovery. This has resulted in increased speed in drug discovery and evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of candidate compounds whilst allowing novel ways of drug design and synthesis based on natural compounds. Recent advances in analytical and computational techniques have opened new avenues to process complex natural products and to use their structures to derive new and innovative drugs. Indeed, we are in the era of computational molecular design, as applied to natural products. Predictive computational softwares have contributed to the discovery of molecular targets of natural products and their derivatives. In future the use of quantum computing, computational softwares and databases in modelling molecular interactions and predicting features and parameters needed for drug development, such as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics, will result in few false positive leads in drug development. This review discusses plant-based natural product drug discovery and how innovative technologies play a role in next-generation drug discovery.},

abstract = {Abstract. The ant subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae comprises three genera of hyperoptic, arboreal ants, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions: Pseudomyrmex (∼200 species, New World), Myrcidris (two species, South America) and Tetraponera (∼100 species, Palaeotropics). The phylogenetic relationships among these ants were investigated using DNA sequence data (∼5.2 kb from 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, wingless, abdominal-A, and long-wavelength rhodopsin genes) and 144 morphological characters, both separately and in combination. Data were gathered from a representative set of forty-nine pseudomyrmecine species, plus eighteen species from various outgroups. There was substantial agreement among the results obtained from different datasets, and from different methods of phylogenetic inference (parsimony, Bayesian inference). The monophyly of the following groups is strongly supported (100{\%} bootstrap support and 1.00 posterior probability in the molecular dataset): Pseudomyrmecinae, Pseudomyrmex, and Pseudomyrmex + Myrcidris. The status of the genus Tetraponera is less clear: the DNA sequence data indicate that the genus is paraphyletic, but morphological features and a unique insertion in the 28S gene support the monophyly of this taxon. Seven of nine Pseudomyrmex species groups, established previously on the basis of morphology alone, are strongly upheld, but monophyly is rejected for the P. pallens group and the P. viduus group. In the latter case, molecular evidence indicates the existence of two independent clades, associated with the ant-plants Triplaris and Tachigali, respectively, whose convergent morphological features had caused them to be placed erroneously in the same species group. The present results confirm an earlier assertion that obligate associations with domatia-bearing plants have arisen at least twelve times in the subfamily. Molecular and morphological data support the hypothesis of a sister-group relationship between Pseudomyrmecinae and Myrmeciinae (84{\%} parsimony bootstrap, combined dataset), which implies a Cretaceous origin of the stem-group pseudomyrmecines in the southern hemisphere. Pseudomyrmecines appear to have arisen in the Palaeotropics and later dispersed from Africa to South America, where they experienced a pronounced burst of diversification.},

Fueled by a wealth of information from new genomic technologies, a new approach, sociogenomics, uses a focus on the genome to integrate the molecular underpinnings and ultimate explanations of social life. This approach has resulted in a massive influx of data from the honey bee genome and transcriptome, a flurry of research activity, and new insights into honey bee biology. Here, we provide an up-to-date review describing how the honey bee has been successfully studied using this approach, highlighting how the integration of genomic information into honey bee research has provided insights into worker division of labor, communication, caste differences and development, evolution, and honey bee health. We also highlight how genomic studies in other eusocial insect species have provided insights into social evolution via comparative analyses. These data have led to several important new insights about how social behavior is organized on a genomic level, including (1) the fact that gene expression is highly dynamic and responsive to the social environment, (2) that large-scale changes in gene expression can contribute to caste and behavioral differences, (3) that transcriptional networks regulating these behaviors can be related to previously established hormonal mechanisms, and (4) that some genes and pathways retain conserved roles in behavior across contexts and social insect taxa.},

To advance conservation and production goals, agricultural practices should be compatible with biodiversity. Traditional or less intensive systems (i.e. with fewer agrochemicals, less mechanisation, more crop species) such as shaded coffee and cacao agroforests are highlighted for their ability to provide a refuge for biodiversity and may also enhance certain ecosystem functions (i.e. pr{\'{e}}dation). 2. Ants are an important predator group in tropical agroforestry systems. Generally, ant biodiversity declines with coffee and cacao intensification yet the literature lacks a summary of the known mechanisms for ant declines and how this diversity loss may affect the role of ants as predators. 3. Here, how shaded coffee and cacao agroforestry systems protect biodiversity and may preserve related ecosystem functions is discussed in the context of ants as predators. Specifically, the relationships between biodiversity and pr{\'{e}}dation, links between agriculture and conservation, patterns and mechanisms for ant diversity loss with agricultural intensification, importance of ants as control agents of pests and fungal diseases, and whether ant diversity may influence the functional role of ants as predators are addressed. Furthermore, because of the importance of homopteran-tending by ants in the ecological and agricultural literature, as well as to the success of ants as predators, the costs and benefits of promoting ants in agroforests are discussed. 4.

abstract = {PURPOSE Exertional rhabdomyolysis can occur in individuals performing various types of exercise but it is unclear why some individuals develop this condition while others do not. Previous investigations have determined the role of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to explain inter-individual variability of serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations after exertional muscle damage. However, there has been no research about the interrelationship among these SNPs. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze seven SNPs that are candidates for explaining individual variations of CK response after a marathon competition (ACE = 287bp Ins/Del, ACTN3 = p.R577X, CKMM = NcoI, IGF2 = C13790G, IL6 = 174G{\textgreater}C, MLCK = C37885A, TNF{\$}\alpha{\$} = 308G{\textgreater}A). METHODS Using Williams and Folland's model, we determined the total genotype score from the accumulated combination of these seven SNPs for marathoners with a low CK response (n = 36; serum CK {\textless}400 U{\textperiodcentered}L-1) vs. marathoners with a high CK response (n = 31; serum CK ≥400 U{\textperiodcentered}L-1). RESULTS At the end of the race, low CK responders had lower serum CK (290±65 vs. 733±405 U{\textperiodcentered}L-1; P{\textless}0.01) and myoglobin concentrations (443±328 vs. 1009±971 ng{\textperiodcentered}mL-1, P{\textless}0.01) than high CK responders. Although the groups were similar in age, anthropometric characteristics, running experience and training habits, total genotype score was higher in low CK responders than in high CK responders (5.2±1.4 vs. 4.4±1.7 point, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION Marathoners with a lower CK response after the race had a more favorable polygenic profile than runners with high serum CK concentrations. This might suggest a significant role of genetic polymorphisms in the levels of exertional muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis. Yet other SNPs, in addition to exercise training, might also play a role in the values of CK after damaging exercise.},

We sequenced and compared the genomes of two socially divergent ant species: Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. Both genomes contained high amounts of CpG, despite the presence of DNA methylation, which in non-Hymenoptera correlates with CpG depletion. Comparison of gene expression in different castes identified up-regulation of telomerase and sirtuin deacetylases in longer-lived H. saltator reproductives, caste-specific expression of microRNAs and SMYD histone methyltransferases, and differential regulation of genes implicated in neuronal function and chemical communication. Our findings provide clues on the molecular differences between castes in these two ants and establish a new experimental model to study epigenetics in aging and behavior.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial gene content is highly variable across extant eukaryotes. The number of mitochondrial protein genes varies from 3 to 67, while tRNA gene content varies from 0 to 27. Moreover, these numbers exclude the many diverse lineages of non-respiring eukaryotes that lack a mitochondrial genome yet still contain a mitochondrion, albeit one often highly derived in ultrastructure and metabolic function, such as the hydrogenosome. Diversity in tRNA gene content primarily reflects differential usage of imported tRNAs of nuclear origin. In the case of protein genes, most of this diversity reflects differential degrees of functional gene transfer to the nucleus, with more minor contributions resulting from gene loss from the cell as a consequence of either substitution via a functional nuclear homolog or the cell's dispensation of the function of the gene product. The tempo and pattern of mitochondrial gene loss is highly episodic, both across the broad sweep of eukaryotes and within such well-studied groups as angiosperms. All animals, some plants, and certain other groups of eukaryotes are mired in profound stases in mitochondrial gene content, whereas other lineages have experienced relatively frequent gene loss. Loss and transfer to the nucleus of ribosomal protein and succinate dehydrogenase genes has been especially frequent, sporadic, and episodic during angiosperm evolution. Potential mechanisms for activation of transferred genes have been inferred, and intermediate stages in the process have been identified by comparative studies. Several hypotheses have been proposed for why mitochondrial genes are transferred to the nucleus, why mitochondria retain genomes, and why functional gene transfer is almost exclusively unidirectional. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Second, interviews conducted with science bloggers reveal the reasons that prompted them to create a blog, and, if applicable, why they have become disillusioned with science journalism.

abstract = {Most transfer RNAs (tRNAs) can translate more than one synonymous codon, and most codons can be translated by more than one isoacceptor tRNA. The rates of translation of synonymous codons are dependent on the concentrations of the tRNAs and on the rates of pairing of each anticodon-codon combination. Translational selection causes a significant bias in codon frequencies in highly expressed genes in most bacteria. By comparing codon frequencies in high and low-expression genes, we determine which codons are preferred for each amino acid in a large sample of bacterial genomes. We relate this to the number of copies of each tRNA gene in each genome. In two-codon families, preferred codons have Watson-Crick pairs (GC and AU) between the third codon base and the wobble base of the anticodon rather than GU pairs. This suggests that these combinations are more rapidly recognized by the ribosome. In contrast, in four-codon families, preferred codons do not correspond to Watson-Crick rules. In some cases, a wobble-U tRNA can pair with all four codons. In these cases, A and U codons are preferred over G and C. This indicates that the nonstandard UU combination appears to be translated surprisingly well. Differences in modified bases at the wobble position of the anticodon appear to be responsible for the differences in behavior of tRNAs in two-and four-codon families. We discuss the way changes in the bases in the anticodon influence both the speed and the accuracy of translation. The number of tRNA gene copies and the strength of translational selection correlate with the growth rate of the organism, as we would expect if the primary cause of translational selection in bacteria is the requirement to optimize the speed of protein production.},

abstract = {Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are calcifying red macroalgae that reef build in their own right and perform essential ecosystem functions on coral reefs worldwide. Despite their importance, limited genetic information exists for this algal group. De novo transcriptomes were compiled for four species of common tropical CCA using RNA-seq. Sequencing generated between 66 and 87 million raw reads. Transcriptomes were assembled, redundant contigs removed, and remaining contigs were annotated using Trinotate. Protein orthology analysis was conducted between CCA species and two noncalcifying red algae species from NCBI that have published genomes and transcriptomes, and 978 orthologous protein groups were found to be uniquely shared amongst CCA. Functional enrichment analysis of these ‘CCA-specific' proteins showed a higher than expected number of sequences from categories relating to regulation of biological and cellular processes, such as actin related proteins, heat shock proteins, and adhesion proteins. Some proteins found within these enriched categories, i.e. actin and GH18, have been implicated in calcification in other taxa, and are thus candidates for involvement in CCA calcification. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of gene content in these species, offering insights not only into the evolution of coralline algae but also of the Rhodophyta more broadly.},

The morphological definition of the P. ferrugineus group is revised to incorporate additional variability in the worker and queen castes. The previous diagnosis of the males, based largely on features of the genitalia, requires little revision. Closely related to the P. ferrugineus group is a clade of five predominantly South American species, here designated and diagnosed as the P. goeldii group. The five species, P. goeldii (Forel), P. laevifrons Ward, P. micans sp. nov., P. obtusus sp. nov., and P. parvulus sp. nov., are char- acterized and illustrated. P. laevifrons and P. micans are closely related and difficult to distinguish, possibly reflecting in- complete isolation. Keys are provided for the identification of the species in both groups.},

abstract = {In this paper, we tested four hypotheses relative to edge and shape effects on ant communities: (i) forest edges have lower species richness than the remnant core; (ii) species richness increases with distance from the edge; (iii) irregularly shaped remnants have lower species richness than more regular remnants; (iv) there is a higher similarity of species composition between edge and core in irregular than in regular remnants. We sampled litter ant communities on the edge and core of ten remnants, in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Species richness was larger at the forest core than at the edges, although did not increase with distance from the edge. Species richness did not vary with shape complexity. The similarity of species composition between edge and core showed a decreasing trend with remnant area, and did not vary with shape complexity. The observed differences of species richness between forest core and edge may be due to higher harshness of edges, caused by environmental changes. The absence of relationship between species richness and distance from the edge might indicate the range of edge effects, which would be smaller than the smallest distance of core sampled. Therefore, edges would affect litter-dwelling ant species richness in a distance smaller than 50 m. The observation of species composition allowed us to notice an effect of fragmentation that would not be noticed if we were considering only species richness. Edge may serve as step to generalist species, which may use it to colonise forest remnants. Furthermore, small remnants are more colonisation-prone by such species, and have a more homogeneous species composition than large remnants.},

abstract = {In species living in seasonally variable environments, the ability to synchronize the timing of breeding with the peak of critical resources is under positive selection within populations. The temporal scheduling of animal annual cycle is controlled by endogenous rhythms, which are set by ‘circadian clock' genes. Many studies have supported the hypothesis that length polymorphism in some ‘phenological genes' is associated with differences in the photoperiodic responses among individ- uals and populations. However, evidence is inconsistent across species, genes and phenological traits. Among birds, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the gene-phenotype association in non-migratory species. To contribute filling this gap, here we analyzed clutch initiation date of females of a species resident at temperate latitudes, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), in relation to the length poly- morphism at four loci previously associated with breeding and migration phenology in other species: Adcyap1 and Npas2 genes, as well as two regions of the Clock gene. Although polymorphism was observed at three loci, allele size of the candi- date genes seems not to predict the timing of breeding in females. In addition, similar genotype frequencies of all the analyzed genes were observed in early com- pared to late breeding females. Our results therefore suggest that the associations between photoperiodic candidate genes and breeding phenotype are not general across species and might represent adaptations of individual populations to the local environment.},

abstract = {The integrity of mitochondrial function is fundamental to cell life. It follows that disturbances of mitochondrial function will lead to disruption of cell function, expressed as disease or even death. In this review, I consider recent developments in our knowledge of basic aspects of mitochondrial biology as an essential step in developing our understanding of the contributions of mitochondria to disease. The identification of novel mechanisms that govern mitochondrial biogenesis and replication, and the delicately poised signalling pathways that coordinate the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are discussed. As fluorescence imaging has made the study of mitochondrial function within cells accessible, the application of that technology to the exploration of mitochondrial bioenergetics is reviewed. Mitochondrial calcium uptake plays a major role in influencing cell signalling and in the regulation of mitochondrial function, while excessive mitochondrial calcium accumulation has been extensively implicated in disease. Mitochondria are major producers of free radical species, possibly also of nitric oxide, and are also major targets of oxidative damage. Mechanisms of mitochondrial radical generation, targets of oxidative injury and the potential role of uncoupling proteins as regulators of radical generation are discussed. The role of mitochondria in apoptotic and necrotic cell death is seminal and is briefly reviewed. This background leads to a discussion of ways in which these processes combine to cause illness in the neurodegenerative diseases and in cardiac reperfusion injury. The demands of mitochondria and their complex integration into cell biology extends far beyond the provision of ATP, prompting a radical change in our perception of mitochondria and placing these organelles centre stage in many aspects of cell biology and medicine. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Although known for their potent venom and ability to prey upon both invertebrate and vertebrate species, the Barychelidae spider family has been entirely neglected by toxinologists. In striking contrast, the sister family Theraphosidae (commonly known as tarantulas), which last shared a most recent common ancestor with Barychelidae over 200 million years ago, has received much attention, accounting for 25{\%} of all the described spider toxins while representing only 2{\%} of all spider species. In this study, we evaluated for the first time the venom arsenal of a barychelid spider, Trittame loki, using transcriptomic, proteomic, and bioinformatic methods. The venom was revealed to be dominated by extremely diverse inhibitor cystine knot (ICK)/knottin peptides, accounting for 42 of the 46 full-length toxin precursors recovered in the transcriptomic sequencing. In addition to documenting differential rates of evolution adopted by different ICK/knottin toxin lineages, we discovered homologues with completely novel cysteine skeletal architecture. Moreover, acetylcholinesterase and neprilysin were revealed for the first time as part of the spider-venom arsenal and CAP (CRiSP/Allergen/PR-1) were identified for the first time in mygalomorph spider venoms. These results not only highlight the extent of venom diversification in this neglected ancient spider lineage, but also reinforce the idea that unique venomous lineages are rich pools of novel biomolecules that may have significant applied uses as therapeutics and/or insecticides. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Enormous molecular sequence data have been accumulated over the last years and are still exponentially growing through faster and cheaper sequencing techniques. There is high and widespread interest in using these data for phylogenetic analyses. However, the amount of data that one can retrieve from public sequence repositories is virtually impossible to tame without dedicated software that automates processes. Here, we present a novel bioinformatic pipeline for downloading, formatting, filtering, and analyzing public sequence data deposited in GenBank. It combines some well-established programs with numerous newly developed software tools (available from http://software.zfmk.de). RESULTS: We used the pipeline to investigate the phylogeny of the megadiverse insect order Hymenoptera (sawflies, bees, wasps, and ants) by retrieving and processing more than 120,000 sequences and by selecting subsets under the criteria of compositional homogeneity and defined levels of density and overlap. Tree reconstruction was done with a partitioned maximum likelihood analysis from a supermatrix with more than 80,000 sites and more than 1,100 species. In the inferred tree, consistent with previous studies, 'Symphyta' is paraphyletic. Within Apocrita, our analysis suggests a topology of Stephanoidea + (Ichneumonoidea + (Proctotrupomorpha + (Evanioidea + Aculeata))). Despite the huge amount of data, we identified several persistent problems in the Hymenoptera tree; data coverage is still extremely low and additional data have to be collected to reliably infer the phylogeny of Hymenoptera. CONCLUSIONS: While we applied our pipeline to Hymenoptera, we designed the approach as general as possible. With this pipeline, it is possible to produce phylogenetic trees for any taxonomic group and to monitor new data and tree robustness in a taxon of interest. It therefore has great potential to meet the challenges of the phylogenomic era, and to deepen our understanding of the tree of life.},

In this paper we analyze primarily the phylogenies of both New World Acacia and of their associated species of ants, and the geographic origin of this mutualism. Until now, there has been no molecular analysis of this relationship in terms of its origin and age. We analyzed three chloroplast markers (matK, psaB-rps14, and trnL-trnF) on a total of 70 taxa of legumes from the subfamily Mimosoideae, and two nuclear regions (long-wavelength rhodopsine and wingless) on a total of 43 taxa of ants from subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae. The monophyly of subgenus Acacia and within the New World lineages that of the myrmecophilous Acacia group was established. In addition, our results supported the monophyly of the genus Pseudomyrmex and of the associated acacia-ants P. ferrugineus group. Using Bayesian methods and calibration data, the estimated divergence times for the groups involved in the mutualism are: 5.44 ± 1.93 My for the myrmecophilous acacias and 4.58 ± 0.82 My for their associated ant species, implying that their relationship originated in Mesoamerica between the late Miocene to the middle Pliocene, with eventual diversification of both groups in Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The loss of biodiversity is an ongoing problem and it is essential that a framework is established for revealing the status, identifying threats and monitoring future changes of populations. This study focuses on wader populations in the East Asian-Australasian flyway, and aims to develop a three-step framework for monitoring the status of populations. First, population changes of waders are quantified by estimating population indices from nationwide survey data in Japan between 1975 and 2008. Second, species characteristics shared by declining waders are identified using a phylogenetic comparative method. Finally, based on the revealed characteristics of declining species, composite indices are created for monitoring changes in wader communities in the East Asian-Australasian flyway. The estimated population indices revealed that 12 species out of 41, and 16 out of 42 have declined significantly during spring and autumn migration, respectively, in at least one of the past 10, 20 or 30 year-periods. Phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed that both the use of rice fields and dependence on the Yellow Sea negatively affected the population trends of waders. These results are consistent with the hypothesized negative impact of agricultural intensification caused by land consolidation in Japanese rice fields, and habitat loss and/or degradation in the Yellow Sea caused by the rapid growth of populations and economies in China and South Korea. The framework developed in this study can be applied to a wide range of species, and should play an important role in monitoring population trends and identifying threats to those species in future. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, despite being a broad geographical region of significant cultural and linguistic diversity, little is known about the population history in North Asia. We present complete mitochondrial genome sequences together with stable isotope data for 41 serially sampled ancient individuals from North Asia, dated between c.13,790 BP and c.1,380 BP extending from the Palaeolithic to the Iron Age. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences and haplogroup data of these individuals revealed the highest genetic affinity to present-day North Asian populations of the same geographical region suggesting a possible long-term maternal genetic continuity in the region. We observed a decrease in genetic diversity over time and a reduction of maternal effective population size (Ne) approximately seven thousand years before present. Coalescent simulations were consistent with genetic continuity between present day individuals and individuals dating to 7,000 BP, 4,800 BP or 3,000 BP. Meanwhile, genetic differences observed between 7,000 BP and 3,000 BP as well as between 4,800 BP and 3,000 BP were inconsistent with genetic drift alone, suggesting gene flow into the region from distant gene pools or structure within the population. These results indicate that despite some level of continuity between ancient groups and present-day populations, the region exhibits a complex demographic history during the Holocene.},

abstract = {The distribution of food resources in space and time is likely to be an important factor governing the type of foraging strategy used by ants. However, no previous systematic attempt has been made to determine whether spatiotemporal resource distribution is in fact correlated with foraging strategy across the ants. In this analysis, I present data compiled from the literature on the foraging strategy and food resource use of 402 species of ants from across the phylogenetic tree. By categorizing the distribution of resources reported in these studies in terms of size relative to colony size, spatial distribution relative to colony foraging range, frequency of occurrence in time relative to worker life span, and depletability (i.e., whether the colony can cause a change in resource frequency), I demonstrate that different foraging strategies are indeed associated with specific spatiotemporal resource attributes. The general patterns I describe here can therefore be used as a framework to inform predictions in future studies of ant foraging behavior. No differences were found between resources collected via short-term recruitment strategies (group recruitment, short-term trails, and volatile recruitment), whereas different resource distributions were associated with solitary foraging, trunk trails, long-term trail networks, group raiding, and raiding. In many cases, ant species use a combination of different foraging strategies to collect diverse resources. It is useful to consider these foraging strategies not as separate options but as modular parts of the total foraging effort of a colony.},

An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluatedfound only 20{\%}-40{\%} of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85{\%} for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85{\%} for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5{\%} for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, bparticularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

The estimated proportion of Brazilian species was 9.5{\%} of theworld total (95{\%} CI, 8.5 to 11.5{\%}). From thiswe estimated a known Brazilian biota of 170,000 to 210,000 species. We used a similar procedure to estimate Brazil's total biota—known plus undiscovered. Based on 17 relatively well-known taxa, the average Brazilian share in the world's biota was estimated at 13.1{\%} (CI 10.0 to 17.6{\%}). Accordingly we estimated the country's total biota at 1.8 million species (CI 1.4 to 2.4 million). Given that the Neotropics is the least-studied major region of theworld, these figures are still likely to be underestimates and hence may be taken as a lower bound of the actual proportion of the world's species that occur in Brazil. Scientists, policy makers, and citizens will find these numbers useful in appreciating the magnitude of the tasks involved in surveying, describing, and conserving the country's biota.

No significant differences in thrips, lepidopteran, or chrysomelid beetle damage to fruits, or to young and old leaves, were associated with these ants. However, significant increases of pseudococcids Planococcus citrii, associated with areas dominated by W. auropunctata, and to a lesser degree with W. cf rochai, were present. W. auropunctata has been reported to be a canopy mosaic dominant in cocoa farms, but the lack of reduced herbivore incidences and its lack of spatial permanence do not support favoring its populations for the management of phytophagous insect control.},

abstract = {Spider ants of the genus Leptomyrmex Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) are conspicuous species of Australasian rainforests, with putative fossil relatives in the Neotropics and Europe. There is longstanding debate over the biogeographical history of the genus, with the Palaearctic and Neotropical regions proposed as alternate centres of origin.We propose a resolution of this debate with the recent discovery and analysis of an extant species from central Brazil, L. relictus sp.n., whichwe describe fromworkers,males and brood.We sequence ten nuclear genes in the new species and in several Australian Leptomyrmex species, and append these data to a 54-taxon, 10-gene data matrix previously generated for the subfamily Dolichoderinae. We conduct phylogenetic and divergence dating analyses, and re-evaluate the fossil record of the group. We recover Leptomyrmex relictus sp.n. as a member of the Leptomyrmex clade with high support. It is sister to the Australasian species, and the genus Leptomyrmex is, in turn, sister to a pair of Neotropical genera, Forelius and Dorymyrmex. We infer a Neotropical origin for the genus and estimate a mid-Eocene (46Ma, 95{\%} CI 56 to 36 Ma) origin for the crown genus and an Oligocene origin for the Australasian clade (29Ma, 95{\%} CI 40 to 19 Ma). We confirm placement of the Dominican amber species †L. neotropicus Baroni Urbani in the genus but reject a close relationship with the Palaearctic fossil taxa †Leptomyrmula Emery and †Usomyrma Dlussky, Radchenko {\&} Dubovikoff, considering them incertae sedis in the subfamily (Dolichoderinae). In contrast to the mesophilic preferences of the Australasian species of Leptomyrmex, the new Brazilian species inhabits cerrado (dry savannah). Our results support a Neotropical origin for spider ants with dispersal to Australia. Rafting on west-bound currents and/or a historical diversity imbalance between Australia and South America are proposed as alternate hypotheses to explain a pattern of biased E–W mid-Tertiary dispersal for ants with austral distributions. This pattern is suggested by our results in conjunction with observations of other ant clades. Overall, our findings highlight the value of integrated taxonomy, critical interpretation of morphology, and a comparative phylogenetic framework when conducting palaeontological and biogeographical studies of insect species.},

However, mitochondrial and microsatellite variation are still commonly used in various kinds of molecular studies, and probably will complement genomic data in years to come. Here we show that besides providing abundant genomic data, UCE sequencing is an excellent source of both sequences for microsatellite loci design and complete mitochondrial genomes with high sequencing depth. Identification of dozens of microsatellite loci and assembly of complete mitogenomes is exemplified here using three species of Poospiza warbling finches from southern and southeastern Brazil.

abstract = {Insect mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) are usually double helical and circular molecules containing 37 genes that are encoded on both strands. The arrangement of the genes is not constant for all species, and produces distinct gene orders (GOs) that have proven to be diagnostic in defining clades at different taxonomic levels. In general, it is believed that distinct taxa have a very low chance of sharing identically arranged GOs. However, examples of identical, homoplastic local rearrangements occurring in distinct taxa do exist. In this study, we sequenced the complete mtDNAs of the ants Formica fusca and Myrmica scabrinodis (Formicidae, Hymenoptera) and compared their GOs with those of other Insecta. The GO of F. fusca was found to be identical to the GO of Dytrisia (the largest clade of Lepidoptera). This finding is the first documented case of an identical GO shared by distinct groups of Insecta, and it is the oldest known event of GO convergent evolution in animals. Both Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera acquired this GO early in their evolution. Using a phylogenetic approach combined with new bioinformatic tools, the chronological order of the evolutionary events that produced the diversity of the hymenopteran GOs was determined. Additionally, new local homoplastic rearrangements shared by distinct groups of insects were identified. Our study showed that local and global homoplasies affecting the insect GOs are more widespread than previously thought. Homoplastic GOs can still be useful for characterizing the various clades, provided that they are appropriately considered in a phylogenetic and taxonomic context.},

In this study, mitochondrial genomes of two stag beetles, Sinodendron yunnanense and Prosopocoilus confucius, are sequenced for the first time. Both of their genomes consisted of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and a control region. The mitogenome of S. yunnanense was 16,921 bp in length, and P. confucius was 16,951 bp. The location of the gene trnL(UUR), between the A + T-rich and control region in S. yunnanense, is the first observed in Lucanidae. In P. confucius, an unexpected noncoding region of 580 bp was discovered. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference on the 13 mitochondrial PCGs were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among 12 representative stag beetles and three scarab beetles. The topology of the two phylogenetic trees was almost identical: S. yunnanense was recovered as the most basal Lucanid, and the genus Prosopocoilus was polyphyletic due to P. gracilis being recovered sister to the genera Dorcus and Hemisodorcus. The phylogenetic results, genetic distances and mitogenomic characteristics call into question the cohesion of the genus Prosopocoilus.

Parameters such as the size and developmental stage of the specimen (egg, larvae, or adult) and the subsequent use of the DNA will mostly determine which method should be used. Ant body sizes range from minute (1-2 mm in length) to large (30 mm), and the volume of the initial digestion should be adjusted accordingly. Whereas workers usually have low concentrations of storage proteins and fat, queens and larvae can contain considerable amounts of these substances that can interfere with the subsequent use of the isolated DNA. Ants also have many glands in the head and abdomen, and the contents of these glands can also interfere with the successful application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or restriction digests of the isolated DNA. This protocol presents two DNA isolation methods that have worked reliably for a wide range of ant species: a "quick and dirty" technique using Chelex isolation, and a more elaborate, classical phenol:chloroform procedure.},

Shorebirds typically leave Southern Hemisphere non-breeding areas over a 3-4 week period, but whether they benefit from interannually consistent timing of departure is unknown. Here, I show that individual bar-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa baueri) from New Zealand are highly consistent in their migratory scheduling. Most birds left within the same week each year (between-year repeatability, r, of 0.83) and adult males, which moult into a bright breeding plumage, were also highly repeatable in the extent of their prebreeding moult (r=0.86). This is consistent with the hypothesis that birds have individually optimized migration schedules. Within adult males, but not females, smaller birds tended to migrate earlier than large birds. Whether this reflects differences in size-related migration speed, optimal breeding time at different sites or size-related natural or sexual selection pressures, remains unknown.},

Comparisons between lures containing 2,5-dimethyl- 3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine singly and in blends (10:1 and 100:1) based on W. auropunctata extracts, failed to show differences in the time required to attract a given number of ants. This indicates a lack of synergistic effects between the compounds under these test conditions. A dose response assay with 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine showed maximal ant response to a 1 mg pheromone lure, a dose which remained attractive for 8 days under field conditions. Several of the field experiments included peanut butter baits, a lure currently used for detection. However, ant counts at peanut butter baits were not greater than at controls suggesting that peanut butter does not produce volatiles that attract ants. With the aim of developing management applications, a series of bioassays were conducted with 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine in combination with food baits. A separate assay was conducted with Tanglefoot, a sticky catch material. In feeding bioassays, the alarm pheromone decreased consumption of peanut butter and solutions of protein and sugar. Tanglefoot squares failed to catch W. auropunctata with any of the lures tested. The field responses of W. auropunctata to alarm pheromone lures show a mixed potential for control applications. While the strong attraction and longevity of lures is promising, the inability to increase bait consumption or capture ants with Tanglefoot presents obstacles to using these alarm pheromone components for ant management.},

I documented the earliest known S. rogeri records for 67 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major Caribbean islands, US states, and Canadian provinces), including many areas for which I found no previously published records: Antigua, Austral Islands, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Comoro Islands, Grenada, Guadeloupe, {\^{I}}les {\'{E}}parses, Martinique, Nevis, Palau, Philippines, St Kitts, St Lucia, St Martin, and Tanzania.

Outside of Africa and Florida, there are only a small number of continental records of S. rogeri, including a few from South and Central America and just one from continental Asia, in peninsular Malaysia. It is unclear whether S. rogeri has not yet spread to these continental areas, whether continental ants have competitively excluded S. rogeri, or whether these ants have been simply overlooked in surveys of diverse continental faunae.

We assembled the mitochondrial genomes of the plastid-sequestering sea slugs Elysia timida and Elysia cornigera from RNA-Seq data that was complemented with standard sequencing of mitochondrial DNA through primer walking.

A neglected but promising use of this large amount of data is to assemble organelle genomes. To assess the reliability of this approach, we attempted to reconstruct complete mitochondrial genomes from RNA-Seq experiments of Reticulitermes termite species, for which transcriptomes and conspecific mitogenomes are available. We successfully assembled complete molecules, although a few gaps corresponding to tRNAs had to be filled manually. We also reconstructed, for the first time, the mitogenome of Reticulitermes banyulensis. The accuracy and completeness of mitogenomes reconstruction appeared independent from transcriptome size, read length and sequencing design (single/paired end), and using reference genomes from congeneric or intra-familial taxa did not significantly affect the assembly. Transcriptome-derived mitogenomes were found highly similar to the conspecific ones obtained from genome sequencing (nucleotide divergence ranging from 0{\%} to 3.5{\%}) and yielded a congruent phylogenetic tree. Reads from contaminants and nuclear transcripts, although slowing down the process, did not result in chimeric sequence reconstruction. We suggest that the described approach has the potential to increase the number of available mitogenomes by exploiting the rapidly increasing number of transcriptomes.},

abstract = {Patterns of variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) increasingly are being investigated in threatened or managed species, but not always with clearly defined goals for conservation. In this review I identify uses of mtDNA analysis which fall into two different areas: (i) 'gene conservation' - the identification and management of genetic diversity, and (ii) 'molecular ecology' - the use of mtDNA variation to guide and assist demographic studies of populations. These two classes of application have different conceptual bases, conservation goals and time-frames. Gene conservation makes extensive use of phylogenetic information and is, in general, most relevant to long-term planning. Appropriate uses here include identification of Evolutionarily Significant Units and assessment of conservation priority of taxa or areas from an evolutionary perspective. Less appropriate are inferences about fitness from within-population diversity and about species boundaries. Molecular ecology makes more use of allele frequencies and provides information useful for short-term management of populations. Powerful applications are to identify Management Units and to define and use naturally occurring genetic tags, Estimating demographic parameters, e.g migration rate and population size, from patterns of mtDNA diversity is fraught with difficulty, particularly where populations are fluctuating, and is unlikely to produce quantitative estimates sufficiently accurate to be useful for practical management of contemporary populations. However, through comparative studies, mtDNA analysis can provide qualitative signals of population changes, allowing efficient targeting of resource-intensive ecological studies. Thus, there are some relatively straightforward uses of mtDNA, preferably in conjunction with assays of nuclear variation, that can make a significant contribution to the long-term planning and short-term,execution of species recovery plans.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been a marker of choice for reconstructing historical patterns of population demography, admixture, biogeography and speciation. However, it has recently been suggested that the pervasive nature of direct and indirect selection on this molecule renders any conclusion derived from it ambiguous. We review here the evidence for indirect selection on mtDNA in arthropods arising from linkage disequilibrium with maternally inherited symbionts. We note first that these symbionts are very common in arthropods and then review studies that reveal the extent to which they shape mtDNA evolution. mtDNA diversity patterns are compatible with neutral expectations for an uninfected population in only 2 of 19 cases. The remaining 17 studies revealed cases of symbiont-driven reduction in mtDNA diversity, symbiont-driven increases in diversity, symbiont-driven changes in mtDNA variation over space and symbiont-associated paraphyly of mtDNA. We therefore conclude that these elements often confound the inference of an organism's evolutionary history from mtDNA data and that mtDNA on its own is an unsuitable marker for the study of recent historical events in arthropods. We also discuss the impact of these studies on the current programme of taxonomy based on DNA bar-coding.},

abstract = {The ruby ant, Myrmica rubra (LINNAEUS, 1758) (formerly Myrmica laevinodis NYLANDER, 1846), an aggressive Eurasian species with a powerful sting, is now spreading through temperate North America. To document the worldwide distribution of M. rubra and evaluate its potential for further spread, we compiled published and unpublished specimen records from {\textgreater}2000 sites. We report the earliest known M rubra records for 71 geographic areas (countries, major islands, US states, Canadian provinces, and Russian federal districts), including three areas with no previously published records: Prince Edward Island, Washington State, and the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia. All earlier published records of M. rubra from East Asia, including the Far East of Russia, Japan, and China, appear to be misidentifications of Myrmica kotokui FOREL, 1911.Myrmica rubra is native to an enormous expanse extending from Ireland and Portugal in westernmost Europe across 8000 km to central Asia and eastern Siberia, and from 39 to 70 degrees N in latitude. Exotic populations of M rubra were first recorded in eastern North America more than 100 years ago. Myrmica rubra is now documented from five southeastern Canadian provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec), six northeastern US states (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont), and one northwestern state (Washington) ranging from 41.5 to 47.6 degrees N.Given the vast range of M rubra in Eurasia, perhaps the most striking aspect about this species in North America is how little it has spread over the past century. Most North American records of M rubra, however, date from the last ten years, suggesting these North American populations are expanding. There appear to be no geographic barriers that would prevent M. rubra from spreading across the US and Canada, from coast to coast.},

Over the past few years, complete plastid genome sequenc-ing has emerged as a powerful and increasingly accessible tool for plant phylogenetics, facilitated by rapid advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (e.g., Moore et al., 2006 , 2007 , 2010 ; Jansen et al., 2007 ; Cronn et al., 2008 , 2012). Many aspects of the plastid genome, including its structural simplicity, relatively small size, and highly conserved gene con-tent, make it ideally suited for next-generation sequencing and assembly. Additionally, its wealth of characters, useful across many taxonomic levels, makes it an excellent resource for phylogenetic studies across the plant branch of the tree of life. Plastome-scale phylogenetic studies have, for example, clarifi ed relationships among major angiosperm lineages (Moore et al., 2007 , 2010 ; Jansen et al., 2007) and resolved recent, rapid radiations in Pinus (Parks et al., 2009). Plastid genomes also have great po-tential for population genetic and phylogeographic studies (e.g., Whittall et al., 2010), particularly as a complement to multiple unlinked nuclear loci, although this application of large-scale plastid data sets has been underexplored compared to deeper-level phylogenetic studies. The ever-increasing capacities of next-generation sequenc-ers, particularly the Illumina platforms, coupled with the high-copy nature of the plastid genome, have made it possible to multiplex numerous samples of whole-genomic DNA (gDNA) on a single lane and still recover suffi cient coverage to assemble complete or nearly complete plastid genomes (e.g., Cronn et al., 2008 , 2012 ; Steele et al., 2012 ; Straub et al., 2012). However, given that plastid DNA typically constitutes only {\~{}}0.5–13{\%} of gDNA samples (Steele et al., 2012 ; Straub et al., 2012), this approach expends much of the sequencing capacity on nuclear reads, signifi cantly reducing the number of plastomes that can be sequenced in parallel. Consequently, this limits the scalability},

abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products corresponding to 803 bp of the cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA COI-II) were deduced to consist of multiple haplotypes in three Sitobion species. We investigated the molecular basis of these observations. PCR products were cloned, and six clones from one individual per species were sequenced. In each individual, one sequence was found commonly, but also two or three divergent sequences were seen. The divergent sequences were shown to be nonmitochondrial by sequencing from purified mtDNA and Southern blotting experiments. All seven nonmitochondrial clones sequenced to completion were unique. Nonmitochondrial sequences have a high proportion of unique sites, and very few characters are shared between nonmitochondrial clones to the exclusion of mtDNA. From these data, we infer that fragments of mtDNA have been transposed separately (probably into aphid chromosomes), at a frequency only known to be equalled in humans. The transposition phenomenon appears to occur infrequently or not at all in closely related genera and other aphids investigated. Patterns of nucleotide substitution in mtDNA inferred over a parsimony tree are very different from those in transposed sequences. Compared with mtDNA, nonmitochondrial sequences have less codon position bias, more even exchanges between A, G, C and T, and a higher proportion of nonsynonymous replacements. Although these data are consistent with the transposed sequences being under less constraint than mtDNA, changes in the nonmitochondrial sequences are not random: there remains significant position bias, and probable excesses of synonymous replacements and of conservative inferred amino acid replacements. We conclude that a proportion of the inferred change in the nonmitochondrial sequences occurred before transposition. We believe that Sitobion aphids (and other species exhibiting mtDNA transposition) may be important for studying the molecular evolution of mtDNA and pseudogenes. However, our data highlight the need to establish the true evolutionary relationships between sequences in comparative investigations.},

Within a colony only a few individuals reproduce (queens and in termites, also a king) while the large majority (workers and soldiers) forgo reproduction, at least temporarily. The evolution of such reproductive altruism can ultimately be explained by inclusive fitness theory. Here, I will review the proximate genetic mechanisms underlying this altruism in termites. As social cockroaches they evolved eusociality independently from the social Hymenoptera, which makes them interesting test cases to look for common underlying mechanisms of eusociality and lineage specific idiosyncrasies. First, I will provide a summary of the genes and their function that have been identified to underlie reproductive division of labor—so called “queen genes,”—in the drywood termite Cryptotermes secundus, an emerging model to study termite social evolution. Second, I outline how widespread these queen genes are across the termite phylogeny, using also evidence from recent genome analyses. I will provide hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of these queen genes, aiming to link proximate mechanisms with ultimate functions. Finally, I will draw comparisons to social Hymenoptera to indicate potential common underpinnings that warrant further testing.},

abstract = {The basal actinopterygians comprise four major lineages (polypteriforms, acipenseriforms, lepisosteids, and Amia) and have been collectively called "ancient fish." We investigated the phylogeny of this group of fishes in relation to teleosts using mitochondrial genomic (mitogenomic) data, and compared this to the various alternative phylogenetic hypotheses that have been proposed previously. In addition to the previously determined complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 14 teleosts and two outgroups, we used newly determined mitogenomic sequences of 12 purposefully chosen species representing all the ancient fish lineages plus related teleosts. This data set comprised concatenated nucleotide sequences from 12 protein-coding genes (excluding the ND6 gene and third codon positions) and 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (stem regions only) and these data were subjected to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses. The resultant trees from the three methods were well resolved and largely congruent, with most internal branches being supported by high statistical values. Mitogenomic data strongly supported not only the monophyly of the teleosts (osteoglossomorphs and above), but also a sister-group relationship between the teleosts and a clade comprising the acipenseriforms, lepisosteids, and Amia, with the polypteriforms occupying the most basal position in the actinopterygian phylogeny. Although the tree topology di8ered from any of the previously proposed hypotheses based on morphology, it exhibited congruence with a recently proposed novel hypothesis based on nuclear markers. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Understanding the molecular basis of how behavioural states are established, maintained and altered by environmental cues is an area of considerable and growing interest. Epigenetic processes, including methylation of DNA and post-translational modification of histones, dynamically modulate activity-dependent gene expression in neurons and can therefore have important regulatory roles in shaping behavioural responses to environmental cues. Several eusocial insect species - with their unique displays of behavioural plasticity due to age, morphology and social context - have emerged as models to investigate the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of animal social behaviour. This Review summarizes recent studies in the epigenetics of social behaviour and offers perspectives on emerging trends and prospects for establishing genetic tools in eusocial insects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Order Charadriiformes (shorebirds) is an ideal model group in which to study a wide range of behavioural, ecological and macroevolutionary processes across species. However, comparative studies depend on phylogeny to control for the effects of shared evolutionary history. Although numerous hypotheses have been presented for subsets of the Charadriiformes none to date include all recognised species. Here we use the matrix representation with parsimony method to produce the first fully inclusive supertree of Charadriiformes. We also provide preliminary estimates of ages for all nodes in the tree. RESULTS: Three main lineages are revealed: i) the plovers and allies; ii) the gulls and allies; and iii) the sandpipers and allies. The relative position of these clades is unresolved in the strict consensus tree but a 50{\%} majority-rule consensus tree indicates that the sandpiper clade is sister group to the gulls and allies whilst the plover group is placed at the base of the tree. The overall topology is highly consistent with recent molecular hypotheses of shorebird phylogeny. CONCLUSION: The supertree hypothesis presented herein is (to our knowledge) the only complete phylogenetic hypothesis of all extant shorebirds. Despite concerns over the robustness of supertrees (see Discussion), we believe that it provides a valuable framework for testing numerous evolutionary hypotheses relating to the diversity of behaviour, ecology and life-history of the Charadriiformes.},

abstract = {Abstract The New World jacanas, Jacana spinosa (Mexico to Panama and also the West Indies) and Jacana jacana (Panama and South America), are polyandrous freshwater waders that are common throughout the Neotropics. These two species hybridize narrowly at their contact zone in Panama, and as part of a study of the hybrid zone dynamics, we present complete, annotated mitochondrial genomes for both species. The two species have very similar mitochondrial genomes, showing identical gene orders, and differing in size in only two RNA features and the control region, and among protein-coding genes, the two genomes had average uncorrected pairwise divergence of 1.8{\%}, ranging from 0.7{\%} for ND4L and 3.6{\%} for ATP8. However, control region divergence is high (∼16{\%}). These mitochondrial genome sequences may be useful tools for understanding jacana hybridization dynamics, especially regarding potential mitonuclear incompatibilities.},

abstract = {The world's natural history collections constitute an enormous evidence base for scientific research on the natural world. To facilitate these studies and improve access to collections, many organisations are embarking on major programmes of digitization. This requires auto- mated approaches to mass-digitization that support rapid imaging of specimens and associ- ated data capture, in order to process the tens of millions of specimens common to most natural history collections. In this paper we present Inselect—a modular, easy-to-use, cross-platform suite of open-source software tools that supports the semi-automated pro- cessing of specimen images generated by natural history digitization programmes. The software is made up of a Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux desktop application, together with command-line tools that are designed for unattended operation on batches of images. Blending image visualisation algorithms that automatically recognise specimens together with workflows to support post-processing tasks such as barcode reading, label transcrip- tion and metadata capture, Inselect fills a critical gap to increase the rate of specimen digitization.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are generally thought to occur after human aided migration to a new range. However, human activities prior to migration may also play a role. We studied here the evolutionary genetics of introduced populations of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata at a worldwide scale. Using microsatellite markers, we reconstructed the main routes of introduction of the species. We found three main routes of introduction, each of them strongly associated to human history and trading routes. We also demonstrate the overwhelming occurrence of male and female clonality in introduced populations of W. auropunctata, and suggest that this particular reproduction system is under selection in human-modified habitats. Together with previous researches focused on native populations, our results suggest that invasive clonal populations may have evolved within human modified habitats in the native range, and spread further from there. The evolutionarily most parsimonious scenario for the emergence of invasive populations of the little fire ant might thus be a two-step process. The W. auropunctata case illustrates the central role of humans in biological change, not only due to changes in migration patterns, but also in selective pressures over species.},
